# Seizure Classification

## Focal Szs

Focal Szs are classified as either preserved (simple partial) or altered (complex partial) awareness. Simple Szs can degenerate into complex, and either can evolve into bilateral, generalized, tonic-clonic szs.

* Aware Partial Szs
  * Limited Convulsions, No LOC, and Limited Sensory Disturbances
  * May Present w/ auras of abdominal discomfort, unpleasant smells, or a sense of fear
* Impaired Awareness Partial Szs
  * Present w/ clouding of consciousness, staring, and repetitive motor behaviors
  * May also present with autonomic dysfunction (diarrhea, vomiting, etc)
  * Auras are common (same SSx as Aware Partial Szs)
  * Most common form of focal Sz

## Generalized Szs

Generalized Szs can be classified as the following

* Absence
  * No Convulsions, Aura, or Post-Ictal Period
  * Typical (Petit-Mal Szs): Brief LOC (10-45s) w/ staring or eye flickering, often repetitive
  * Atypical: Slower onset than Petit-Mal and more difficult to control
* Myoclonic
  * Shock-Like Muscle Contractions
  * Isolated location jerking (head, trunk, etc)
* Tonic
  * Often occur in children
  * Increased rigidity of extensor muscles
* Clonic
  * Often occur in children
  * Rapid, repetitive motor activity
* Tonic-Clonic (Grand-Mal)
  * Cyclical tonic phase (15-30s of muscle rigidity) followed by clonic phase (1-2min of violent jerking)
  * Tremor begins to develop in tonic phase as clonic phase begins
  * Commonly presents w/ urinary incontinence
  * Characteristic of Epilepsy
* Atonic
  * Sudden loss of muscle tone
* Status Epilepticus
  * Single Sz or Multiple Szs w/o baseline consciousness for &ge; 30min
  * Usually begin treatment after &gt; 5min

## Post-Ictal States

Post-Ictal states can last from seconds to hours, and depending upon the length of the Sz, age of the patient, use of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), and areas of the brain that are affected.

### SSx

* Confusion
* Disorientation
* Anterograde Amnesia

# Seizure Pathophysiology

An imbalance in Excitatory and Inhibitory Post-Synaptic Potentials leads to the development of a Sz. Excitatory potentials are often caused by AMPA and NMDA receptors (glutamate receptors) leading to Ca influx and depolarization. Hyperpolarization is often mediated by GABA receptors leading to K efflux through both voltage gated and Ca defendant K efflux channels. Tonic phases of Szs are often carried out by loss of GABA mediated inhibition leading to excessive activation by glutamate, and clonic phases/oscillations occur due to the reintroduction of GABA mediation. 

# Status Epilepticus Managment

## Common Triggers

* Prenatal Injury
* Hemorrhage
* Infection
* Trauma
* Tumors
* Cerebrovascular Disease
* Anoxia
* Hyperventillation / Respiratory Alkalosis
* Hypoglycemia
* Sleep Deprivation
* Stress
* DTs
* AED Withdrawal
* Repetitive Light Stimulation

## Drug Triggers

* EtOH
* Burpropion
* Theophylline
* Imipenem
* Phenothiazines
* Oral Contraceptives
* Tramadol
* Depressant Withdrawal (Esp EtOH and Benzos)
* Meperidine
* CNS Stimulants
* Memantine
* Heave Metal Toxicity
* Clozapine

## Management of Status Epilepticus

1. 0-5min
   * ABCs
   * EEG
   * Blood Glucose
     * If &lt; 60, give 100mg IV Thiamine and 50mL IV D5W
   * CBC w/ Diff
   * Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)
   * Toxicology Screen
2. 5-20min
   * Midazolam IM 10mg if &gt; 40kg or 5mg if 13-40kg (one dose)
   * Lorazepam 0.1 mg/kg IV (Max 4 mg/dose) (Max of 2 doses)
   * Diazepam 0.15-2 mg/kg IV (Max 10 mg/dose) (Max of 2 doses)
   * Phenobarbital 15 mg/kg/dose IV (single dose, **not preferred agent**)
   * Diazepam 0.2-0.5 mg/kg Rectal (Max 20 mg/dose) (**not preferred agent**)
   * Intranasal Midazolam or Buccal Midazolam (**not preferred agent**)
3. 20-40min
   * Fosphenytoin 20 mg PE/kg IV (Max 1500 mg PE/dose, single dose) (PE = Phenytoin Equivalents)
   * Valproic Acid 40 mg/kg IV (Max 3000 mg/dose, single dose)
   * Levetiracetam 60 mg/kg IV (Max 4500 mg/dose, single dose)
   * Phenobarbital 15 mg/kg/dose IV (single dose, **not preferred agent**)
4. 40-60min
   * Repeat Second Line Therapy (Step 3) OR
   * Anesthetic Doses of the following PLUS Continuous EEG
     * Thiopental
     * Midazolam
     * Phenobarbital
     * Propofol

# Seizure Management

## Criteria for Considering D/C of AED

2-5yr Sz free period

Risk Factors for recurrence include:

* &lt; 2 years seizure free
* Onset of seizure after age 12
* History of atypical febrile seizures
* 2-6yr before good seizure control in treatment
* Significant number of seizures (&gt; 30) before control achieved
* Partial seizures (which is the most common type)

* Abnormal EEG throughout treatment
* Organic neurological disorder
  * Traumatic brain injury
  * Dementia
* Withdrawal of phenytoin or valproate

## Medication Therapy

### Phenytoin / Fosphenytoin

* Phenytoin: 20 mg/kg IV w/ a second dose after 10min if needed
* Phenytoin: Maximum Infusion Rate of 50 mg/min IV
* Fosphenytoin: 20 PE/kg IV w/ a second dose after 10min if needed
* Fosphenytoin: Maximum Infusion Rate of 150 PE/min IV
* Phenytoin Limiting SE of Infusion rate is hypotension due to propylene glycol 
* Monitor for purple glove syndrome
* Cardiac Monitoring Required
* Oral Dose Conversion
  * Adjusted Concentration: $$\frac{\text{Observed Concentration}}{0.25*\text{Albumin}+0.1} $$
  * Albumin and serum concentration must be measured at the same time
* Target Concentration: 10-20 mcg/mL


## Valproate

* Load 15-20 mg/kg

* Follow with 15 mg/kg QD titrated to Max 60 mg/kg QD

  * IV given in divided doses given Q6H

* IV:PO Conversion is 1:1

* Loading Dose Calculation

  * Dose: $$V_d * ([\text{Desired}]-[\text{Current}]) * Wt $$
  * V<sub>d</sub>: 0.2-0.3 L/kg
  * Target Concentration: 80 mcg/kg (50-125 mcg/mL)
