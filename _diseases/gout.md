# Pathophysiology

Inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in the joint. Hyperuricemia is defined as urate levels &ge; 6.8 mg/dL. 

## Purine Metabolism

**INSERT IMAGE OF PURINE METABOLIC PATHWAY HERE**

# Risk Factors

* Age
* Low kidney function
* Male
* High BP
* Obesity
* EtOH use

# SSx

Severe pain and inflammation around tophi (urate deposits), most commonly in the big toe

# Treatment

## Acute Flairs

* NSAIDs at highest recommended dose until 24hr after SSx resolution
  * Indomethacin 50mg PO TID
  * Naproxen 750mg then 250mg PO q8hr
  * Sulindac (Clinoril) 200mg PO bid
* Colchicine
  * Load 1.2 mg PO then 0.6mg 1hr later
  * Continue 0.6mg QD or BID 12 hrs later until resolution of attack
  * CrCl &lt; 30: Do not repeat treatment w/i 14d, and 0.3mg QD prophylactic dose
  * HD: 0.6mg PO x1 do not repeat w/i 14d, and 0.3mg twice weekly prophylactic dose
  * SEs
    * N / V / D
    * Bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia, and thrombocytopenia
    * Myopathy
    * Rhabdo
  * Inhibits leukocyte migration and phagocytosis via interactions with microtubules
  * Comparable to NSAIDs in efficacy
  * Best to start w/i 24hr of SSx onset
* GCs
  * Most commonly used w/ multiple joint involvement or resistant cases
  * Prednisone, methylprednisolone, and triamcinolone all common
  * Prednisone 0.5 mg/kg QD x5-10d or 0.5 mg/kg x2-5d then 7-10d taper
  * Methylprednisolone 21d dose pack
  * Triamcinolone 60mg IM x1 dose then PO prednisone as above, or 2.5-40mg intra-articular x1 dose
* Combine Colchicine and NSAIDs, Colchicine and PO GCs, or Intra-articular GCs and any other treatment

## Maintenance

* Indications
  * Two or more attacks per year
  * Presence of tophi
  * Presence of renal stones
  * CKD Stage 2 or worse

1. Xanthine Oxidase Inhibitors
   * Allopurinol 100mg PO QD NTE 800mg QD
     * Slowly titrate q2-4wks
     * 50mg PO QD w/ CKD 4
     * CrCl 10-20: NTE 200mg PO QD
     * CrCl 3-10: NTE 100mg PO QD
     * CrCl &lt; 3: Consider QOD
     * SEs: Rash, pruritus, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, N / V / D, SJS / TEN, eosinophilia, vasculitis
     * Screen fro HLA-B\*5801 in Asian ethnicities to decrease risk of SJS / TEN
   * Febuxostat 40mg PO QD NTE 80mg QD
     * No renal adjustments
     * Do not initiate or stop during an attack
     * Data limited for CrCl &lt; 30 and severe hepatic impairment
     * Expensive
     * SEs: Rash, N /D, LFT elevations, increased risk of thromboembolism
     * CI: Azathiprine, mercaptopurine, or theophylline use
     * Monitoring: LFTs at baseline, 2mo, and 4mo
2. Uricosurics (Added to above)
   * Inhibition of uric acid reabsorption in the PCT
   * Probenecid 250mg PO BID x7d then 500mg BID x14d NTE 2g qd
     * Titrate by 500mg q1-2wks as needed
     * SEs: Flushing, HA, GI Upset, Kidney Stones, Aplastic anemia / leukopenia
     * CIs: Salicylate use, blood dycrasias, uric acid kidney stones, CrCl &lt; 50, acute attack
3. Uricase Therapy
   * Converts uric acid into allantoin
   * Pegloticase 8mg IV Infusion q2wks over 120min
   * Pretreat w/ antihistamines and GCs
   * SEs: Infusion related events, nephrolithiasis, anaphylaxis, arthralgia, CHF exacerbation, nausea
   * CIs: G6PD Deficiency
   * Avoid in CHF pts
4. Miscellaneous Therapies
   * Lesinurad (Zurampic) 200mg PO QD
     * Inhibits urate transporter increasing excretion
     * Can use with xanthine oxidase inhibitors
     * SEs: Acute renal failure (black-box), HA, GERD

## Prophylaxis

* Colchicine 0.6mg PO QD or BID
* Naproxen 250mg PO BID
* &lt; 10 mg prednisone equivalents QD

## Monitoring

* Serum Urate x2-5 weeks during initiation, then q6mo once &lt; 6 mg/dL
