# Cardiac Anatomy

# Stable Angina

## Pathophysiology

Stable angina is caused by a temporary increase in O<sub>2</sub> demand by cardiac myocytes in the prescense of a diminished O<sub>2</sub> supply, most commonly the result of severe ASCVD leading to significant decreases in blood flow (&gt;70%) through the coronary arteries **without** myocardial necrosis. Stable angina can be of either a fixed threshold, a variable threshold, or both. Stable angina should have stable characteristics for at least 2 months.

## Clinical Presentation and Dx

### Dx

* Look for risk factors
* ST-Depression **During** Angina
* Stress Test
* Cardiac Catheterization
* Electron Beam CT (AHA does not reccomend because results will not change recommendation)

### PQRST

* Precipitating Factors: Exertion etc
* Palliative Measures: Rest and/or SL NTG
* Quality of Pain: Squeezing, heaviness, tightening, etc
* Region and Radiation: Substernal, ocassionally radiating to left arm
* Severity of Pain: Generally &gt;5
* Timing: Typically 5-10min, must be &lt; 20

### Common Precipitating Factors

* Cold Air (leads to increased HR)
* Large Meals
* Exertion
* Smoking

### EKG Findings

ST-Depression **only during episodes of angina**, EKG is otherwise unremarkable

## Treatment
