# Indications[^stollings]

* **Risk of Aspiration**
* Traumatic injury (d/t decreased gastric emptying)
* GERD
* DM
* s/p esophogeal surgeries
* Ascites
* Small Bowel Obstruction

# Premedication[^stollings]

* Anxiety / Aggitation
  * Midazolam 1-2mg IV
  * Onsets 60-90s
  * Lower in elderly, higher in obese
  * Watch out for concurrent opioid use
* Prevention of Sympathetic Surge
  * Fentanyl 1-3 mcg/kg IV over 30-60s 3min before RSI
  * Onsets in &lt; 30s
  * Especially important to prevent ICP spike
* Bradycardia / Bradycardia Prevention
  * Atropine 0.01-0.02 mg/kg IV
  * Onset: 2-16min
  * Esp useful in its who are on rate control
* Hypotension
  * Phenylephrine 50-200mcg IV
  * See [Push-Dose Pressors]({{ site.baseurl }}/drugClasses/pressors#push-dose-epi-) for Epi
  * Onset: &lt; 30s
  * Duration: 5min
* Secretion Management
  * Glycopyrrolate 0.2mg IV [^lexi]
  * Takes time to onset

# Induction

## Induction Agents[^stollings]

* Propofol
  * 1.5 mg/kg IV (usually 100-200mg) (Wt)
  * 1/2 dose in elderly pts
  * Decreases ICP and sympathetic tone
  * Bronchodilator
  * **Drug of choice for pregnancy (Cat. B)**
  * Caution in shock d/t hypotension
* Etomidate
  * 0.2-0.6 mg/kg IV (usually 20-50mg; 0.3 mg/kg)
  * Minimal CV effects
  * Decreases ICP
  * Causes myoclonus
  * Causes adrenal suppression, clinical relevance is not known
* Ketamine
  * 1-2 mg/kg (commonly 100mg) AdjBW
  * Sympathomimetic
  * Bronchodilator
  * Can worsen hypotension in pts who are catecholamine depleted
    * NTE 1.5 mg/kg in pts w/ prolonged hypotension
  * Pts w/ severe HF may suffer more from ketamine's negative inotropic effects than benefit from sympathomimetic activity in vasculature, leading to hypotension
  * Pretreatment with BZDs may prevent emergence phenomenon
* Ketofol
* Midazolam
  * 0.2-0.3 mg/kg IM
  * Onset: 5min
  * Onset w/ opioids: 90s
  * Dose decrease in hemodynamic instability
  * **Useful if no IV / IO access**

## Paralytics[^stollings]

* Succinylcholine
  * 1-2 mg/kg IV Wt (common 100mg)
  * 3-4mg/kg IM Wt (common 300mg)
  * **Hyperkalemia**
    * 0.5-1 mEq/L rise
    * 5-10 mEq/L rise in pts with ALS, stroke, MS, and spinal cord injury
  * Onset: &lt; 60s IV / 3-4min IM
  * Duration: ~ 5min
  * Bradycardia common in peds
    * Most noticeable with propofol
  * Myasthenia graves may need higher doses
  * Pseudocholinesterase deficiency may last for 6-8hrs
  * Can cause malignant hyperthermia
    * Give Dantrolene 2.5 mg/kg
* Rocuronium
  * 0.6-1.2 mg/kg
  * Lasts longer than all bolus induction meds, and effects may be prolonged in those with liver failure
* Sugammadex
  * 16 mg/kg
  * Reverses rocuornium, vecuronium, and pancuronium
  * Works in ~3min
* Neostigmine
  * 0.03-0.07 mg/kg
  * Give with glycopyrrolate to prevent bradycardia
  * Can help to reverse non-depolarizing blockade
