# ACS

1. MONA
   * Morphine 2-4mg IV q5-30min in increments of 2-8mg PRN
     * BP and RR after each bolus
     * Can consider meperidine or other opiod
     * D/C all NSAIDs and avoid all NSAIDs during admission
   * O<sub>2</sub> to sat of 95% if &lt; 90% on presentation
   * SL NTG 0.4mg q5min x3, if non-responsive start IV NTG 5-10mcg/min to 75-100mcg/min (Max 200, consider 1-2min bolus of 400mcg/min to load)
     * **Verify NO PDEIs w/i 24-36hr**
     * IV Contraindicated w/ SBP &lt; 90; &gt; 30 mmHg change from baseline; Bradycardia or Tachycardia; **Suspected RV Infarction**
     * Monitor BP and HR q2h while on IV
   * ASA 325mg Chewed and Swallowed on presentation
   * Consider anxiolytics to decrease HR and demand
2. Consider PCI for STEMI
3. Consult [ACS]({{ site.baseurl}}/diseases/acs.html) for further management

# Stroke

## Labs
* Conduct NIHSS (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale)
* **Head CT** to r/o hemorrhagic stroke
* Monitor **BP** / O<sub>2</sub>Sat
* **BG**
* BMP
* CBC
* INR / aPTT
* EKG
* Echo
* **Pt is NPO until swallow study conducted**

## Initial Therapies
* Manage BG if abnormal
  * Hypoglycemia can result in stroke SSx
  * Hyperglycemia above 180 mg/dL can result in higher morbidity / mortality
* Consider thrombolytics for ischemic strokes (must r/o hemorrhagic)
* Manage HTN to &lt; 220/120 for non-thrombolytic pts, &lt; 180/105 for thrombolysis
  * IV antihypertensives warranted, do not lower BP excessively, as elevated BP may help perfuse partially occluded areas
  * Agressive BP control can limit stroke recurrence, long-term neuro deficits, an decrease risk of cerebral edema; however concern from above usually wins, attempt to balance (i.e 150s instead of 170s or 110s)

## Thrombolysis
### Dosing
* **Must satisfy inclusion / exclusion criteria below**
* 0.9 mg/kg NTE 90mg Total dose
  * 10% (0.09 mg/kg) IVPB over 1min
  * 90% (0.81 mg/kg) IV over 60min
* Give w/i 60min of arrival
* Keep BP &lt; 180/105
  * Monitor q15min x2h then q30min x 6h then q1h x16hr
  * Can begin to lower to outpt goal after 24h
* Avoid **all** antiplatelets and anticoagulants for 24hr post-admin

### SEs
* Bleeding
* Stroke Conversion
* Cerebral Edema

### Inclusion Criteria
* Ischemic stroke confirmed by imaging
* &lt; 3hrs from SSx onset
  * Extended interval available, see below
  * Some evidence for imaging-based determination of thrombolysis eligbility [here](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1804355), but not currently in guidelines
* &ge; 18yo

### Exclusion Criteria
* Evidence of active internal bleed
* Hx of intracranial hemorrhage
* Previous stroke or head trauma in less than 3mo
* GI or GU hemorrhage in &le; 21d
* Major surgery in &le; 14d
* MI in &le; 3mo
* **BP &gt; 185/110 at administration time**
* **BG &lt; 50 mg/dL**
* Plt &lt; 100k
* Current anticoag w/ INR &gt; 1.7 or aPTT &gt; 45s
  * NOACs CI tPA
  * **Reversible exclusion criteria**

### Extended tPA Window
* &lt; 4.5hrs after SSx onset
* Add the following to the exclusion criteria
  * Age &ge; 80
  * Hx of Stroke w/ DM
  * Any recent anticoag use
  * NIHSS &gt; 25
  
## BP Control
* Use common IV antihypertensives discussed in [HTN Crisis section]({{ site.baseurl }}/diseases/htn#emergency)
* Labetalol 10-20mg IVPB q10-20min NTE 300mg
* Nicardipine 5mg/hr IV titrated q5min NTE 15 mg/hr
* Nitroprusside 0.5-10 mcg/kg/min titrated (preferable if DBP &gt; 140)

# Transfusion for Severe Acute Anemia

* Criteria
  * Acutely Symptomatic
  * Hgb &lt; 8 (some argue 7)
* Admin PRBCs
  * Type and cross before admin
  * 1 U &approx; 300 mL &approx; &Delta; 1 g/dL Hgb
  * Consider activation of massive transfusion protocol
  * Hemorrhaging / trauma pts may require infusions of FFP and Plt as well to sustain coagulation, strongly consider before using large volumes of crystalloid
  * Pts refusing transfusion can be given high dose iron, B12, and Epo, look up protocol
* Complications
  * Iron Overload
  * Infection (HIV etc, rare)
  * Hyperviscosity syndrome
  * Alloimmunization
  * Volume overload
  * Transfusion reactions
