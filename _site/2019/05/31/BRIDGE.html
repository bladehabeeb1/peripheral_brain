<h1 class="title">BRIDGE - Perioperative Bridging Anticoagulation in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation</h1>
<h2>2019-05-31 </h2>

<div class="contents">
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>

<h2 id="primary-question">Primary Question</h2>

<p>In patients with afib without mechanical valves, is no bridging noninferior with respect to thromboembolism risk and superior with respect to bleeding risk when compared to perioperative bridging with dalteparin (LMWH)?</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In patients with Afib and a CHADS<sub>2</sub> ≤ 3 (or maybe 4) without a mechanical, cancer, bridging before and after surgery appears to increase the risk of bleeding without modifying the risk of stroke.</p>

<h1 id="pico">PICO</h1>
<h2 id="population">Population</h2>

<p>Individuals with Afib, including valvular Afib, but not those with mechanical valves. Populations were skewed towards white males, with CHADS<sub>2</sub> Scores ≤ 3-4. Cancer was not well represented in this trial. Nor were stroke / TIA Hx.</p>

<h2 id="intervention--comparison">Intervention / Comparison</h2>

<p>D/C warfarin on Day (-5), Dalteparin or placebo on Day (-3), then restarting Dalteparin or placebo after the procedure until INR was therapeutic.</p>

<h2 id="outcomes">Outcome(s)</h2>

<p><strong>Primary:</strong> Arterial thromboembolism (stroke, TIA, systemic embolism) at 37d post-op</p>

<p>​	Non-inferior, not superior</p>

<p><strong>Secondary:</strong> Major bleeding, death, acute MI, DVT, PE, minor bleeding</p>

<p>​	No bridging was superior for Major Bleeding, minor bleeding was a superior exploratory endpoint, others not significantly different.</p>

<h2 id="the-study-population-included-or-focused-on-those-in-the-relevant-specialty-ie-the-er--icu">The study population included or focused on those in the relevant specialty? (i.e. the ER / ICU)</h2>

<p>Relevant to surgical patients with afib without cancer or a mechanical valve</p>

<h2 id="adequate-randomization">Adequate Randomization?</h2>

<p>Yes</p>

<h2 id="randomization-was-concealed">Randomization was concealed?</h2>

<p>Yes</p>

<h2 id="selection-bias--consecutive-enrollment">Selection bias / consecutive enrollment?</h2>

<p>No mention of convenience sampling etc</p>

<h2 id="baseline-demographics-were-similar">Baseline demographics were similar?</h2>

<p>Yes, slightly more cancer in non-bridging group</p>

<h2 id="blinding">Blinding?</h2>

<p>Double blind</p>

<h2 id="equal-treatment-except-intervention">Equal treatment except intervention?</h2>

<p>Yes, but treating physicians were given discretion in determining whether pts were high or low bleeding risk and were permitted to choose time to restart bridging based upon this</p>

<h2 id="complete-fu--80-fu-in-both-groups">Complete f/u (&gt; 80% f/u in both groups)</h2>

<p>Yes</p>

<h2 id="all-pt-important-outcomes-are-considered">All pt important outcomes are considered?</h2>

<p>Yes</p>

<h2 id="adequate-sample-size-and-large-enough-tx-effect-to-be-notices">Adequate sample size and large enough Tx effect to be notices?</h2>

<p>Rates of thromboembolic events were lower than initially expected, so pre-specified ranges for noninferiority were wider than likely appropriate.</p>

<h1 id="comments--problems">Comments / Problems</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Median time to thromboembolism after surgery was 19d, when pts should have been adequately anticoagulated on warfarin alone. Why?</li>
  <li>Most pts underwent a low bleeding risk procedure (89.4%), although having more high-risk pts would only bias towards non-bridging due to increased bleeding events</li>
  <li>Relatively few patients had a history of TIA/stroke</li>
</ul>
