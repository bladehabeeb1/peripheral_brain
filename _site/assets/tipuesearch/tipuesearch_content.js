    "text": "Physiology Acid-base regulation is essential for maintenance of physiologic functions, and is primarily controlled through respiratory and renal means. The underlying chemical buffering of the blood is primarily maintained by HCO3- ions, which can become carbonic acid when combined with a proton. The Henderson-Hasselbach equation for this equilibrium is . This is equivalent to . pCO2 is controlled by respiration, while [HCO3-] is regulated by the kidneys. Buffers Extracellular bicarbonate and proteins along with intracellular phosphate and proteins are responsible for the majority of buffering within the body. The buffering system is rapid, but the magnitude of response is limited due to the finite supply of buffer in the body, although the supply of bicarbonate is relatively unlimited. Renal Regulation The kidneys help to maintain proper acid-base balance by regulating the amount of bicarbonate and hydrogen ions in the blood. Most bicarbonate is reabsorbed in the PCT utilizing carbonic anhydrase (CA). Carbonic anhydrase confers bicarbonate in the urine into CO2, which diffuses into the cells of the PCT. CA in the PCT then converts the CO2 back into bicarb intracellularly. The bicarb follows sodium back into the blood stream. During this process, hydrogen ions are circulated with the bicarbonate: they are combined with bicarbonate in the lumen when CO2 is formed, then they are released intracellularly when bicarb is reformed. The hydrogen ions then diffuse out into the lumen through ion channels to be re-used. This results in no net change in hydrogen ions in the body or urine. The kidneys are also capable of generating bicarbonate in two ways: Ammonium Excretion and “Titratable Acidity”. Ammonium excretion utilizes a similar process to bicarbonate reabsorption, except ammonia is allowed to diffuse into the urine. Upon entry into the acidic urine, ammonia is protonated and trapped in the urine. This sequesters hydrogen ions from the bicarbonate production process that occurs intracellularly, and leads to a net production of bicarbonate. This process can produce approximately 40-300 mEq of bicarbonate daily. The final mechanism of renal acid-base regulation is titratable acidity. This process involves utilizing filtered phosphate in the urine to sequester hydrogen ions as well, leading to increased amounts of bicarbonate production. This process can produce approximately 30 mEq of bicarbonate daily. Beyond the production of bicarbonate, the DCT and collecting duct are capable of secreting hydrogen ions. Hepatic metabolism of amino acids also contributes to this process, as it is the primary source of ammonium. This ammonium is usually controlled via urea production (), and therefore changes in the urea cycle can lead to acid base disturbances (decreases in urea production leads to metabolic alkalosis via preserved bicarbonate and increased ammoniagenesis). Respiratory Regulation Respiratory regulation is primarily used in acute states to compensate for insults as well as to compensate for impaired renal function. Hyperventilation decreases pCO2 leading to respiratory alkalosis, and the hypoventilation produces the opposite effect. Acid Production The body produces approximately 1 mEq/kg/d of H+ due to the oxidation of proteins and fats. Approximately 0.8 mEq/kg of H+ myst be excreted from the body from non-volatile acids produced during anaerobic metabolism as well as during the breakdown of cysteine, methionine, and phospholipids.

Condition Compensation Metabolic Acidosis Metabolic Alkalosis Acute Respiratory Acidocis Chronic Respiratory Acidocis Acute Respiratory Acidosis Acute Respiratory Alkalosis Metabolic Acidosis Metabolic acidoses are characterized by decreased levels of bicarbonate in the blood. Metabolic acidoses are split into two categories: anion gap and non-anion gap acidoses. In acidotic pts with a low bicarbonate, an anion gap and delta gap should be calculated. A normal anion gap is 3-11 mEq/L, if the anion gap is elevated, the patient has an anion gap acidosis. If the patient has an anion gap calculate the delta gap. If the bicarb plus the delta gap is an elevated bicarb (&gt; 26 mEq/L), the patient is suffering from a mixed metabolic acidosis/alkalosis. Anion gap pts should also have a lactate drawn. If the is a normal anion gap, the patient is likely suffering from lactic acidosis.

This acidosis and hypokalemia. K is further lost as Na is reabsorbed in the collecting duct, as a counter-ion must be exchanged, and it cannot be hydrogen. Causes SLE Myeloma Sickle Cell Li+ Amphotericin B Toluene Toxicity Cirrhosis Type II RTA Bicarbonate cannot be reabsorbed in the PCT leading to bicarb wasting sodium loss (to balance the charge of the lost bicarb). This leads to increased fluid loss resulting in secondary hyperaldosteronism and hypokalemia. Causes Heavy Metal toxicity Wilson’s Disease CA Inhibitors Topiramate Vit D Deficiency Type IV RTA Lack of aldosterone prevents the secretion of hydrogen in the collecting duct. This prevents ammoniagenesis, and also creates a potassium-sparing effect causing hyperkalemia.

If change is in opposite direction with relatively normal pH, consider a mixed (opposing) or triple disorder Quantitative Acid-Base Evaluation Notes on calculations: The approximate SID is appropriate unless the pt is suffering from hyperkalemia. Normal SID for the approximation is 38, while the Normal Exact SID is 42. Base deficits should be given by the ABG, but this approximation can be used if the ABG does not provide a BD Order ABG, Lactate, Albumin, Acetone, and Blood Chemistry Is the pt acidotic? Is pCO2 &gt; 45 or &lt; 35 &gt; 45 implies respiratory acidosis &lt; 35 implies respiratory alkalosis Is SID &gt; or &lt; Normal &lt; Normal implies SID metabolic acidosis (non-anion gap) &gt; Normal implies metabolic alkalosis Is the lactate elevated? Consider causes of lactic acidosis, and consider Step 6 to determine if the patient’s problem is exclusively due to lactic acidosis SIG &gt; 2 or Negative? &gt; 2 implies Anion-Gap Acidosis Negative implies hypercalcemia, hypermagnesemia, hyperkalemia (if not using accurate SID calculation), bromides, nitrates, or Lithium overdose Compensation Respiratory Problem: Metabolic Acidosis: Metabolic Alkalosis: COPD Pts: Osmolar Gap for Elevated SIG w/o Explanation Osm Gap &gt; 10: Methanol, Ethalene Glycol, Isopropanol, Lithium Osm Gap &gt; 50: Almost certainly toxic alcohol See the EM-Crit Acid-Base Evaluation Sheet for more details on Quantitative Acid Base NS, 1/2NS, and D5W Acidotic Mechanism The acidosis associated with infusions of non-balanced crystalloid fluids has nothing to do with the presence of Cl-, the weak base of HCl. It instead has to do with the dilution of the body’s natural buffer, bicarbonate. Dilution of endogenous bicarb with significant volumes of crystalloid leads to a shift in the equilibrium point of the Henderson-Hasselback equation. Holding pCO2 constant (pCO2 is held constant because the lungs will rapidly return pCO2 to the appropriate physiologic value) shows that decreasing the bicarbonate concentration leads to a decrease in pH. This result is supported by the Quantitative Acid-Base approach to fluid acidity. NS, 1/2NS, and D5W all have SID=0, implying they are highly acidic fluids due to the dilutional effects on albumin and bicarb. However, fluids such as LR, which have a SID of 24-28 (due to the contents of 24-28 mEq/L of lactate, which is converted to bicarbonate), will not dilute the buffering bicarbonate or concentrate it (as would be the case in infusions of more concentrated bicarbonate solutions). Therefore, solutions with an SID lower than the patient’s current bicarbonate will induce acidosis, while solutions with an SID higher than the patient’s current bicarbonate will induce alkalosis.",

    "text": "Pathophysiology COPD COPD is characterized by chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and inflamed airways. Emphysema is the abnormal enlargment of airspaces due to the destruction of alveolar wall tissue. Bronchitis is characterized by the inflammation of the bronchioles leading to hypertrophy and fibrosis of the respiratory smooth muscle, accompanied by mucosal gland enlargement and ciliary abnormalities. In the case of COPD, inflammation refers to increased oxidative stress, increased levels of proteases with decreased levels of antiproteases, as well as inflammation due to irritants such as cigarette smoke. Asthma IgE mediated mast cell activation leads to the release of histamine, tryptase, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins leading to bronchoconstriction and vasodilation. Over the following hours, TH2 lymphocytes are activated, leading to the release of interleukins and GM-CSF, which results in mucosal hyper secretion, goblet cell proliferation, and eosinophilic infiltration of lung tissue. Excessive immune activation also leads to some fibrosis of the airway. Lastly, due to chronic activation, smooth muscle hypertrophy is exhibited.

    "text": "Cardiac Anatomy Athlerosclerosis Athlerosclerosis occluds arteries, and when a large amount of a coronary artery is obstructed, angina can occur. The process of athlerosclerotic development is as follows: LDL accumulation and oxidation in the wall of a vessel Macrophage infiltration and uptake of the LDL deposit Formation of foam cells Smooth Muscle proliferation and Cap formation Cap rupture Thrombosis General Angina Pathophysiology Oxygen demand to cardiac tissue exceeds the ability of coronary circulation to supply oxygen to the cardiac myocytes, leading to ischemia and chest pain Oxygen Supply and Demand Preload: Decreased preload is caused by veinous vasodilation, resulting in decreased oxygen consumption and increased myocardial perfusion Afterload: Decreased afterload is caused by arterial vasodilation, leading to decreased oxygen consumption Heart Rate: Decreased HR leads to decreased oxygen consumption and increased coronary perfusion Risk Factors Age: ≥ 55 for men or ≥ 65 for women Smoking DM HTN Kidney Disease Obesity Sedentary Lifestyle Stable Angina Pathophysiology Stable angina is a demand ischemia caused by a temporary increase in O2 demand by cardiac myocytes in the prescense of a diminished O2 supply, most commonly the result of severe ASCVD leading to significant decreases in blood flow (&gt;70%) through the coronary arteries without myocardial necrosis. Stable angina can be of either a fixed threshold, a variable threshold, or both. Stable angina should have stable characteristics for at least 2 months.

ACEIs in CAD ACEIs and ARBs have been show to stabilize plaques, improve endothelial function, inhibit smooth muscle migration, decrease macrophage infiltration, and possibly decrease oxidation of LDL. All CAD patients, especially those with CHF with LVEF ≤ 40%, HTN, DM, or CKD should be on an ACEI or ARB. Symptomatic Control Acute Nitrates SL Nitroglycerin is the preferred agent for acute attacks, given as either 0.3-0.6mg SL tabs or 0.4mg/spray SL spray. NTG tablets cannot be stored in vials other than that which they are shipped in, and cannot, by law, have childproof caps. It is appropriate to have a patient keep a diary of nitrate use to record the frequency of their attacks the frequency of rescue NTG use. Dosing Sit Down (Risk of Hypotension) Take 1 dose Wait 5 minutes If pain does not resolve, call 911 and take a second dose Take a maximum of 3 doses as needed β-Blockers Beta-Blockers work via decreasing myocardial contractility and heart rate, decreasing oxygen demand. Cardioselective agents such as Metoprolol (&lt;100mg dose) and Atenolol (&lt;50mg dose) are prefered, and beta-blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity should be avoided due to the increased resting HR. β-blockers should be dosed to achieve either: RHR 50-60, exercise HR &lt; 100, or exercise HR 75% of HR causing angina. For the specific behavor of β-blockers, see their section in Sympatholytics. CCBs Long acting DHP CCBs or non-DHP CCBs are appropriate therapy choices for prevention of anginal episodes. Consider the distinct behaviors of the DHP (vasodilatory similar to nitrates) and non-DHP (negative inotropes and chronotropes, similar to β-blockers, but with small amounts of vasodilation) classes in determining appropriate therapy. Non-DHPs have the significant and unique monitoring parameter of constipation, especially verapamil. IR DHP CCBs should be avoided due to marked tachycardia. Chronic Nitrates ISDN, ISMN, and transdermal NTG are commonly used. These agents should not be used as monotherapy due to a required washout period of 10-12hrs with no drug on board to prevent tolerance. Other downsides include frequency of administration (BID-QID). Ranolazine Ranolazine inhibits late-Na influx into cardiac myocytes, which during ischemia can change the sodium gradient enough to reverse Ca transport into the cell, creating a positive feedback loop of contraction and damaging the ischemic tissue. Ranolazine has no impact on BP or HR, but can cause long Q-T intervals, which has been shown to relate to increased risk of sudden cardiac death. Ranolazine is a third line agent and is typically used in combination with multiple other agents or if adequate control cannot be reached with dual therapy due to decreased HR and BP. Side Effects Constipation Nausea Dizziness Headache Dose-Dependent QT Prolongation Ivabradine Ivabradine can be used off label for angina in adults unable to tolerate β-blockers, with no arrhythmias and a RHR ≥ 70. This medication can also be used in combination with β-blockers if adequate control could not be reached with an adequate β-blocker dose.

Prinzmetal’s angina typically presents at night when parasympathetic tone is higher. Treatment See the above treatment algorithm under “Vasospastic Angina” DHP CCBs and Nitrates are recommended based upon blood pressure AVOID β-blockers as they can induce coronary vasospasm",

High phos leads to hypocalcemia both directly and indirectly. Indirectly, Phos leads to a decrease in calcitriol in an effort to decrease Phos absorption from the gut, which also decrease Ca absorption and impairs Ca deposition in bone. This hypocalcemia increases the levels of PTH (in combination with the activity of the Phos directly on the PT gland), leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism. PTH leads to increased bone demineralization. The metabolic acidosis and Al overload also commonly seen in these pts contributes to bone demineralization and osteoporosis.

    "text": "Pathophysiology MS is a progressive neuroinflammatory disease in which neurons are demyelinated in response to an autoimmune reaction. The reaction is thought to be initiated or enhanced by viral infections, particularly by EBV; however EBV is not considered to be the direct cause of MS (i.e. pts can develop MS w/o EBV, but EBV can act as a “catalyst” in susceptible pts). There is also some association between MS and certain HLA phenotypes, IL-2α receptor phenotypes, and IL-7α phenotypes. Autoimmune Responses in MS Dendritic cells present Myeline Basic Protein and other antigens to lymphocytes α4-integrin allows for leukocyte migration into the CNS Demyelination and Neuronal Conduction The regions of axon under myelin often contain primarily K channels. After demyelination, Na channels infiltrate the region, and this migration and the accompanying dysregulation of the channels may explain the loss of proper conduction in demyelinated axons. Remyelination Glial cells and CD4 T-cells release neurotrophin which promotes the migration of Oligodendrocyte Progenitor Cells and neuronal stem cells to the lesion. These cells then attempt to repair the inflammatory damage. If astrocytes invade the area first, astrogliosis (scaring) of the area can occur instead. In MS there is often a lack of OPCs or OPCs fail to differentiate. MS Classification Relapsing-Remitting MS (RRMS) The most common form of MS. Symptomatic phases and relapsing phases occur in a cyclical manner. These relapses are accompanied by spikes in inflammatory markers; however neurodegeneration is constantly occurring (not just during the inflammatory phases). During the remitting phases the patient will return to or near to baseline. These phases can last for weeks or months. Secondary Progressive MS (SPMS) Eventually almost all RRMS will progress to SPMS. This is a non-inflammatory phase of the disease where neurodegenration continues with no remission. Primary Progressive MS (PPMS) PPMS is essentially MS which begins as SPMS. The patient has continuous neurodegeneration which does not improve, but has no relapses or their associated inflammatory markers. Progressive Relapsing MS (PRMS) Acute relapses and steadily worsening condition from the onset of the disease. There is no remission between relapses. Clinically Isolated Syndromes An initial episode of Neurological SSx lasting for more than 24hrs. Most commonly this condition will progress to MS. Marburg Variant MS An aggressive form of MS presenting initially with a large number of lesions and high amounts of inflammation which often resembles a brain tumor. Dx Must have at least 2 demyelination related episodes May use the Expanded Disability Stats Scale (EDSS) 0-10 (0: Normal Exam, 10: Death from MS) Average score of 4 in RRMS w/i 7yrs of Dx SSX Common Visual problems; e.g. monocular blindness (optic nerve), double vision Numbness, tingling (often an early symptom) Fatigue, motor weakness (corticospinal tract) Difficulty walking, gait problems, falls; ataxia (cerebellum) Pain (sensory pathways) Spasticity (stiffness, involuntary muscle spasms) Dizziness, vertigo (vestibular pathways) Sexual dysfunction Bladder problems, constipation Emotional or cognitive changes; depression Uncommon Tremor Szs Itching (pruritis), feeling of pins and needles Speech and swallowing issues Breathing problems (chest muscles affected by nerve damage) HA Hearing loss Predictors of Quicker Progression Short time between relapses Progressive from Dx Older age at onset Abnormal baseline MRI Relapse Management High Dose Steroids Inpatient: Methylprednisolone 500-1000mg (yes mg) IV QD x3-7d (w/ or w/o PO taper over 1-3d) Most pts are admitted Pts w/ optic neuritis should be admitted and given IV methylprednisolone Outpatient: Prednisone PO 1250mg (yes 1250mg) QOD x5doses w/o taper Other Options ACTH Plasma Exchange Chronic Management See “Disease Modifying Therapies in MS” by Dr. Ott for dosing, comprehensive SEs and monitoring parameters.

Inhibits lymphocyte proliferation. Dimethyl Fumarate (Tecfidera, may be second line) MOA: Prodrug metabolized by esterase’s which activated Nrf2-mediated cellular antioxidant response. Suppresses T cells and dendritic cells. May promote remyelination. Nrf2: Nrf2 is constantly ubuquinated by Keap1, destroying it. During times of oxidative stress, Keap1 is damaged, allowing Nrf2 to enter the nuclear and activate genes controlled by the Antioxidant Response Element. This increases glutathione synthesis and Glutathione-S-Transferase synthesis. This GSH can be release by astrocytes to break down extracellular oxidative stressors, or broken down and reassembled in neurons to detoxify intracellular stressors. PML Risk in Pts with JCV Igs, must test for JCV Igs before initiating therapy Daclizumab (Zinbryta, may be second line) CI in Hx of Autoimmune hepatitis or hepatic impairment (LFTs ≥2x ULN) Avoid Live Vaccines up to 4mo after therapy TB test prior to initiation Second Line Natalizumab (Tysabri) MOA: MAB against α4-integrin, prevents binding with β1-integrin to form VLA-1 which combines with VCAM-1 to allow leukocyte infiltration of the CNS PML Risk in Pts with JCV Igs, must test for JCV Igs before initiating therapy Immunocompromised pts, pts with active viral hepatitis, active malignancy, or inability to have an MRI cannot take natalizumab Mitoxantrone (Novantrone) MOA: Cytotoxic agent via DNA breaks (via DNA intercalation) and delay of DNA repair via inhibition of Topoisomerase-II. Inhibits lymphocyte proliferation Cardiomyopathy rLVEF Irreversible CHF Baseline and yearly LVEF Treatment Resistant Alemtuzumab (Mentrada) Anaphylaxis risk, must monitor for 2hr post infusion Can cause thrombocytopenia Increased risk of thyroid cancer, lymphoproliferative disorders, and melanoma Baseline TSH and q3mo to 48mo past final dose Baseline and yearly skin exams Do not give if there is an active infection Do not give live-attenuated or live vaccines CI in HIV PPMS Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) CI in Hep B, must screen before 1st dose Can be used in RRMS, but place in therapy is currently unknown Does Decrease relapse rate in RRMS Do not give if there is an active infection Do not give live-attenuated or live vaccines Increased risk of cancer Infusion reaction common, premedicate with GCs/antihistamine/antipyretic Symptomatic Management See “Symptoms Associated with MS and Treatment Options” by Dr. Ott for comprehensive SSx of MS and their management. Pseudobulbar Affect Characterized by inappropriate episodes of crying, laughing, or both unrelated to current mood. Treat with Neudexta (Dextromethorphan/Quinidine). Dextromethorphan agonizes σ-1receptors, suppressing neurotransmitter release, as well as antagonizing NMDA receptors. Quinidine inhibits CYP2D6 increasing blood levels of dextromethorphan. Gait Abnormalities Dalfampridine (Ampyra) blocks K channels, prolonging action potentials and conduction speed in demyelinated neurons. SEs of ER formulation include UTIs, insomnia, dizziness, HA, nausea. IR formulation can cause Szs (CI in Hx of Szs). Pregnancy and MS Teriflunomide is Cat X (wait 2yrs after D/C or accelerate w/ cholestyramine) Mitoxantrone is Cat D (Contraception &amp; pregnancy test required before every dose) Fingolimod (D/C 2mo before conception) Glatiramer is Cat B All others Cat C Relapse rates decrease during pregnancy, then increase for 3mo post-partum Do not breastfeed if on MS therapy Ocrelizumab may cause fetal harm Medical Marijuana Only decreases subjective spasticity scores, not objective Cannabis extract decreases central pain THC probably decreases painful spasms Useless for tremor, bladder dysfunction Guillain-Barré Syndrome GBS behaves very similarly to MS, but occurs in the peripheral nervous system instead of the CNS. It is often preceded by GI or respiratory infections, and can lead to paralysis in a matter of days. Patients are usually treated with supportive care (ventilation) and plasmapheresis.",

    "title": "Stroke",
    "text": "Pathophysiology Ischemic Ischemic strokes are either atherosclerotic or embolic. Athlerosclerotic strokes have vascular disease in cerebral vessels, which can rupture in a similar manner to an MI, occluding cerebral vessels. Embolic strokes result from an arterial clot (or in rare cases a DVT in pts with a septal malformation), most commonly the result of A-fib. These clots mobilize and enter the cerebral vasculature, occluding arterial blood supply. Both circumstances lead to anoxic brain injury. Ischemic strokes are much more common than hemorrhagic strokes Hemorrhagic Hemorrhagic strokes often result from a cerebral vasculature aneurism or from severe uncrontrolled HTN. This leads to the vessel rupturing and this rupture produces anoxic brain injury in the area supplied by the ruptured vessel, as well as some direct neuronal damage from the hematoma.

    "title": "Seizure Disorders",
    "text": "Seizure Classification Focal Szs Focal Szs are classified as either preserved (simple partial) or altered (complex partial) awareness. Simple Szs can degenerate into complex, and either can evolve into bilateral, generalized, tonic-clonic szs. Aware Partial Szs Limited Convulsions, No LOC, and Limited Sensory Disturbances May Present w/ auras of abdominal discomfort, unpleasant smells, or a sense of fear Impaired Awareness Partial Szs Present w/ clouding of consciousness, staring, and repetitive motor behaviors May also present with autonomic dysfunction (diarrhea, vomiting, etc) Auras are common (same SSx as Aware Partial Szs) Most common form of focal Sz Generalized Szs Generalized Szs can be classified as the following Absence No Convulsions, Aura, or Post-Ictal Period Typical (Petit-Mal Szs): Brief LOC (10-45s) w/ staring or eye flickering, often repetitive Atypical: Slower onset than Petit-Mal and more difficult to control Myoclonic Shock-Like Muscle Contractions Isolated location jerking (head, trunk, etc) Tonic Often occur in children Increased rigidity of extensor muscles Clonic Often occur in children Rapid, repetitive motor activity Tonic-Clonic (Grand-Mal) Cyclical tonic phase (15-30s of muscle rigidity) followed by clonic phase (1-2min of violent jerking) Tremor begins to develop in tonic phase as clonic phase begins Commonly presents w/ urinary incontinence Characteristic of Epilepsy Atonic Sudden loss of muscle tone Status Epilepticus Single Sz or Multiple Szs w/o baseline consciousness for ≥ 30min Usually begin treatment after &gt; 5min Post-Ictal States Post-Ictal states can last from seconds to hours, and depending upon the length of the Sz, age of the patient, use of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), and areas of the brain that are affected. SSx Confusion Disorientation Anterograde Amnesia Seizure Pathophysiology An imbalance in Excitatory and Inhibitory Post-Synaptic Potentials leads to the development of a Sz. Excitatory potentials are often caused by AMPA and NMDA receptors (glutamate receptors) leading to Ca influx and depolarization. Hyperpolarization is often mediated by GABA receptors leading to K efflux through both voltage gated and Ca defendant K efflux channels. Tonic phases of Szs are often carried out by loss of GABA mediated inhibition leading to excessive activation by glutamate, and clonic phases/oscillations occur due to the reintroduction of GABA mediation.

The reaction presents as a diffuse, morbiliform rash. There is some cross reactivity with TCAs because of this. Common offenders include: Carbamazepine Oxcarbazepine Eslicarbazepine Felbamate Lamotrigine Phenobarbital Phenytoin Zonisamide Carbamazepine and its derivatives are the most common offenders, and a significantly increased risk of this reaction occurs in patients carrying HLA-B*1502, which is most commonly seen in Asian populations. HLA-A*3101 conveys some risk as well, and is common in those of Northern European descent. DRESS Syndrome Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms is a life threatening allergic reaction which commonly initially presents with a similar rash to measles. The reaction then progresses to organ dysfunction and multi-system organ failure. DRESS commonly occurs 2-6wks after initiating one of the following: Carbamazepine Lamotrigine Phenobarbital Phenytoin Valproate Zonisamide HLA-A*3101 (common in Asians and Northern European Populations) is commonly associated with an increased risk of DRESS syndrome. Treat by withdrawing drug and providing supportive care. Anticonvulsant Withdrawal Syndrome Anticonvulsant withdrawal refers to the increased risk of Szs associated with abrupt discontinuation of anticonvulsant medications. Common other SSx include: Anxiety Agitation Other Physical Complaints Anticonvulsant withdrawal syndrome can be prevented by slowly tapering patients off medication. Tapers of the course of a year are appropriate for trial D/C due to lack of Szs. Patients with non-life threatening SEs should be tapered slowly, but can be tapered faster than 1 year. Consider the longest taper medically feasible without undue danger or suffering to the patient. Pregnancy and Anticonvulsant Medications Sz frequency increases during pregnancy, and dosing regimens may change. Unfortunately many anticonvulsants are known teratogens such as: Carbamazepine Clonazepam Fos-/Phenytoin Phenobarbital Primidone Topiramate Valproate These medications should not be used in pregnancy if at all possible. Pregnant patients should be supplemented with Folate 5mg QD and consider Vit K 10mg QD in the last month of pregnancy followed by Vit K 1mg IM (for the infant) at birth. Depression and Epilepsy Sz disorder pts are at high risk for epilepsy. All anticonvulsants increase risk of suicidal thinking/behavior. Antidepressant therapy carries an increased risk of suicidal thinking/behavior in those &lt; 24yo. Many antidepressants also have CYP interactions to consider. Bupropion should not be used in patients with Sz disorders as it decreases the Sz threshold. CVD and Anticonvulsants QTc Shortening: Rufinamide PR Changes: Lacosamide, Pregabalin Peripheral Edema: Pregabalin, Gabapentin Heart Block: Lacosamide (Caution w/ conduction abnormalities) Arrhythmia: Fos-/phenytoin (CI in Heart Block) Electrolyte, Acid-Base, and Metabolic Abnormalities and Anticonvulsants Carbamazepine / Eslicarbaepine / Oxcarbazepine: Hyponatremia and SIADH Zonisamide: Metabolic Acidosis and Renal Calculi Phenytoin: Decreased levels of Vit D leading to osteoporosis Topiramate: CA Inhibitor leading to decreased serum bicarb, metabolic acidosis, and nephrolithiasis Miscellaneous Therapy Ketogenic diets are somewhat effective at reducing Sz frequency, and it is more effective in children Vagal Nerve Stimulation Deep Brain Stimulation Responsive Neurostimulation Surgery to remove Sz focus",

Post-ganglionic neurons from a single ganglion can innervate multiple neurons, and utilize NE as their neurotransmitter Parasympathetic preganglionic neurons are long, meeting the ganglia which rest near their target organ. The postganglionic neurons are short, innervate a single organ, and utilize ACh. Unique ANS Innervations Sweat Glands Post-ganglionic sympathetic neurons secrete ACh to stimulate sweating Kidneys Sympathetic innervations of renal vasculature secrete dopamine to cause vasodilation Adrenal Glands The adrenal glands act as sympathetic ganglion, i.e. preganglionic neurons release ACh onto nicotinic receptors in the gland, leading to epinephrine and norepinephrine release into systemic circulation ANS Receptors Receptor Signaling Pathway Nicotinic Receptor Na Influx M1,3,5 Gq M2,4 GI/O α1 Gq α2 Gi β GS Physiologic Parameter Symp.

(retinoids and beta-carotene) Involved primarily in vision, but also as hormones Stored in the liver (and Vit A overdose can be hepatotoxic) Dietary sources include dark green vegetables, liver, egg yolk, and fatty dairy products Deficiency is rare, but can lead to night vision blindness Vit D (Cholecalciferol and Ergocalciferol) Provitamin D3 can be produced in the skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol A cis double bond in Pro-D3 is isomerized into D3 (cholecalciferol) Cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol (Vit D2 from plants) are then hydroxylated in the liver to form 25-hydroxy Vit D3, and again in the kidney to form 1,25-dihydroxy Vit D3 or calcitriol, the active biologic agent responsible for calcium homeostasis Deficiency is rare, but causes Rickets in children and Osteomalacia in adults Dietary sources include fortified milk, saltwater fish, liver, and egg yolk Vit E (Tocopherols and Tocotrienols) Function as potent antioxidants protecting unsaturated fatty acids May prevents LDL oxidation helping to prevent CVD Dietary sources are vegetable oils rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids Deficiency is rare Vit K Functions as an enzyme cofactor for the glutamate post-translational modification to carboxyglutamic acid, which is essential for allowing proteins to tightly bind Ca Vit K dependent post-translational modifications are required for bone mineralization (hydroxyapatite production) and coagulation (multiple clotting factors are Vit K dependent) Deficiency is rare Dietary sources include green, leafy vegetables for Vit K1 and gut bacterial synthesis for Vit K2 Hydrophilic Vitamins Vit B1 (Thiamin) Utilized as an enzyme cofactor in many enzymes via carbanion production, including many enzymes involved in glucose metabolism Severe deficiency is known as beriberi, which is characterized by muscle weakness Deficiency is most commonly seen in alcoholics, and administration of dextrose containing fluids in thiamin deficient patients can result in Wernicke’s Encephalopathy Pretreat w/ 100mg IM or slow IVPB in suspected deficiency May need up to 1000mg in the 1st 24hrs Chronic deficiency can also lead to Korsakoff’s psychosis, which is irreversible and responds poorly to antipsychotics (but they should still be used) Vit B2 (Riboflavin) Used as an enzyme cofactor (FAD and FMN) Deficiency is rare, but SSx include Cheilitis, Glossitis, and Scaly dermatitis, and is most commonly seen in alcoholics Dietary sources include milk, meat, eggs, and cereal products Vit B3 (Niacin) Converted to NAD and NADP Deficiency (pellagra) is common in pts with malabsorption diseases or alcoholics Pellagra presents with “The 3 D’s”: Dermatitis, Dementia, and Diarrhea Dietary sources include meats, peanuts, and enriched cereals Vit B6 (Pyridoxine) Pyridoxal phosphate is a cofactor for neurotransmitter and sphingolipid synthesis as well as amino acid metabolism Severe deficiency is uncommon, with SSx including irritability, nervousness, and depression in mild cases and peripheral neuropathy and Szs in severe deficiency Dietary sources include meats, vegetables, and whole-grain cereals Vit B7 (Biotin) Cofactor for the conversion of carboxylates to CO2 Deficiency is somewhat rare, and most common in pregnant women Biotin binds incredibly tightly to avidin in egg whites (used throughout biochemical studies and assays, as well as a potential cause of deficiency) Vit B9 (Folate) Converted to tetrahydrofolate which is essential for one-carbon metabolism in a.a. and nucleotide synthesis Deficiency is most common in alcoholics, with notable SSx of macrocytic anemia and neural tube defects in children born to pregnant women with the deficiency Vit B12 (Cobalamin) Co containing “heme” group Required for two human biochemical reactions: methionine synthase (homocysteine into methionine) and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (methylmalonyl-CoA into succinyl-CoA) Deficiency leads to homocysteine and methylmalonate accumulation causing macrocytic anemia and neurologic damage Deficiency can be dietary or “pernicious anemia” in which the absorptive cofactor (intrinsic factor) is absent or non-functioning Deficiency is most commonly seen in long-term vegetarians or malabsorption diseases Vit C (Ascorbic Acid) Cofactor for lysine hydroxylation (essential for collagen production) Reducing agent promoting iron absorption and protection of oxidation prone vitamins (A, E, and some B) Deficiency (Scurvy) marked by slow wound healing, decreased immunocompetency, osteoporosis, leading from mucosal membranes (especially the gums), and ulcerations across the body Refeeding Syndrome SSx Szs Coma Arrhythmias Lactic Acidosis Pulmonary Edema Fluid Overload Monitoring SSx Mg K Phos Prevention

    "text": "Coagulation Cascade Clotting Factors are produced exclusively in the liver, with the exception of vWF (endothelium, subendothelium, and megakaryocytes) and Factor VIII (liver and endothelium). The cascade begins when Tissue Factor (TF) binds to Factor VII after vascular wall injury exposes extra-vascular tissue. This process begins the extrinisic pathway. The intrinsic pathway is initiated by thrombin (Factor IIa) cleaving Factor XII in response to exposed collagen from damaged endothelial cells. The coagulation cascade is naturally inhibited by Antithrombin III (AT, neutralizes Thrombin, Xa, and IXa), Protein C (neutralizes Va and VIIIa), and Xa (activates Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor).

Avoid by starting enoxaparin. If HIT II occurs, switch to fondaparinux. Warfarin MOA: Inhibition of Post-Translational Modification of Factors II (Prothrombin), VII, IX, and X along with Proteins C and S via inhibition of Vitamin K Reductase (which regenerates reduced vitamin K for post-translational modificaiton) Warfarin takes approximately 3-5 days to reach maximal effect due to the half-lives of the respective clotting factors Prothrombin (factor II): 60-100 hours Factor VII: 4-6 hours Factor IX: 20-30 hours Factor X: 24-40 hours Protein C and S have significantly shorter half-lives, and initiation of warfarin therapy can temporarily lead to an increase in coagulability. This can lead to ischemia and Warfarin Induced Necrosis. Warfarin is a mix of S and R enantiomers, the S enantiomer being 5x more effective at inhibiting Vit K Reductase. Dosing Dosed to reach a goal INR of 2-3 for prophylaxis or treatment of VTE, treatment of PE, prevention of symbolic emboli, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and mechanical aortic valve.

This leads to non-linear pharmacokinetics. Phenytoin is also highly protein bound, and induces CYP enzymes leading to a large number of drug interactions Iminostilbenes (Carbamazepine, etc.) MOA Iminostilbenes bind and stabilize the incativated state of Na channels in the brain in a similar way to hydantoins (their 3D structures are very similar); however their planar structures are tricyclic. Iminostilbenes induce hepatic CYPs leading to many drug interactions Example Drugs Carbamazepine Oxcarbazepine Lacosamide MOA Enhances the inactivation of Na channels Ca Channel Inhibitors Clinical Uses Absence Szs only Succinimides MOA Inhibition of T-Type Ca Channels in thalamic neurons Example Drugs Ethosuximide (Zarontin) Methsuximide (more toxic) Phensuximide (less effective) Mixed Na and Ca Inhibitors Lamotrigine (Lamictal) MOA Inhibition of Ca and Na channels (has effects of both classes, and can therefore be used for more than absence Szs). Also disrupts glutamate release Valproate (Depaken, Depakote) MOA Inhibition of Ca and Na channels (has effects of both classes, and can therefore be used for more than absence Szs). Increases GABA levels by stimulating glutamic acid decarboxylase or inhibiting GAt-1 or GABA-T GABAergic Drugs Barbiturates MOA PAM of GABAA receptors increasing the duration of Cl entry into the post-synaptic neuron (an inhibitory signal). At high concentrations these drugs can also inhibit Na and Ca channels. Primidone may have more similar behaviors to phenytoin. Example Drugs Phenobarbital (Luminal) Primidone (Mysoline) Benzodiazepines MOA PAM of GABAA receptors increasing the frequency of Cl opening events, hyperpolarizing the post-synaptic neuron. Example Drugs Diazepam (Valium) Lorazepam (Ativan) Clonazepam (Klonopin) GABA Analogs MOA Increases GABA release and potentially decreases presynaptic Ca influx reducing glutamate release. Example Drugs Gabapentin (Neurontin) Pregabalin (Lyrica) Vigabatrin (Sabrile) MOA Analog of GABA which irreversibly inhibits GABA transaminase, which normally degrades GABA. Mat also inhibit GAT. Tiagabine (Gabatril) MOA Inhibits GAT-1 (GABA vesicular transporter) Glutamate Antagonists Felbamate (Felbatol) MOA NMDA Antagonist (NMDA Usually triggers influx of Na and Ca, along with Efflux of K) and enhanced GABAA signaling. Topiramate MOA AMPA (Na influx and K efflux) and Kainate antagonist. Inhibition of Na Channels. Enhanced GABAA signaling. Misc Anticonvulsants Levetiracetam (Keppra) MOA Binds SV2A (Synaptic Vesicular Protein) interfering with neurotransmitter release. May also interfere with Ca influx in presynaptic neurons Brivaracetam (Briviact) MOA Analog of levetiracetem with higher affinity for SV2A",
