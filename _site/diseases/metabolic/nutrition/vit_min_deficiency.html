<h1 class="disease-titles">Vitamin and Mineral Deficiency</h1>

<div class="disease-page">
<button class="accordion">Fat Soluble Vitamins</button>
<div class="panel">
<h2>Vitamin A (<em>Retinol, retinal, and retinoic acid</em>)</h2>

<p><strong>Physiology:</strong> Retinoic acid is used as a steroid hormone for regulating cell growth and differentiation. Retinoic acid is stored in the liver as an ester of palmitate, forming retinol palmitate</p>

<p><strong>Pathophysiology:</strong> Symptomatic deficiency of vitamin A is rare, but 40-60% of Americans consume less than 2/3 of the RDA. Symptomatic deficiency is marked by night blindness.</p>

<h2>Vitamin D</h2>

<p><strong>Physiology:</strong> A steroid hormone used primarily in calcium homeostasis. Vitamin D can be synthesized via exposure to sunlight or absorbed in the GI tract.</p>

<p><strong>Pathophysiology:</strong>
<em>Rickets</em> (children) <em>osteomalacia</em> (adults)</p>

<h2>Vitamin E (<em>tocopherols</em> and <em>tocotrienols</em>)</h2>

<p><strong>Physiology:</strong> Vitamin E functions as an antioxidant to protect against the oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids. Vitamin E accumulates in cellular membranes, adipose tissue, and lipoproteins. By preventing the oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids in LDLs, vitamin E prevents the atherogenic oxidized LDL from forming, lowering atherosclerotic plaque formation.</p>

<p><strong>Epidemiology:</strong> Deficiency is rare</p>

<h2>Vitamin K</h2>

<p><strong>Physiology:</strong> Vitamin K is utilized as an enzyme cofactor used to modify glutamate side chains into carboxyglutamate which promotes the binding of the side chain to calcium. The carboxyglutamate is then utilized in the clotting cascade and for bone mineralization.</p>

<p><strong>Epidemiology:</strong> Vitamin K deficiency is rare.</p>

<p><strong>Drug Interactions:</strong> Warfarin acts as a vitamin K antagonist, and inhibits the regeneration of vitamin K via epoxide reductase</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Water Soluble Vitamins</button>
<div class="panel">
<h2>Thiamin (<em>Vitamin B1</em>)</h2>

<p><strong>Physiology:</strong> Thiamin pyrophosphate is utilized as a cofactor, and it acts as a carbanion (strong nucleophile). Thiamin triphosphate is utilized in nerve signal transmission in the peripheral nervous system.</p>

<p><strong>Pathophysiology:</strong> <em>Beriberi's</em> symptoms include muscular atrophy and weakness, and it is commonly seen in alcoholics and in populations which rely on polished rice as a food source.</p>

<h2>Riboflavin (<em>Vitamin B2</em>)</h2>

<p><strong>Physiology:</strong> Enzyme cofactor for REDOX reactions (FAD and FMN).</p>

<p><strong>Pathophysiology:</strong> Symptoms include angular cheilitis, glossitis, and scaly dermatitis, and the deficiency is commonly found in chronic alcoholics</p>

<h2>Niacin (<em>Vitamin B3</em>)</h2>

<p><strong>Physiology:</strong> Niacin is converted to one of two cofactors, NAD or NADP, and those cofactors are used as electron carriers. Niacin has been shown to lower blood pressure.</p>

<p><strong>Pathophysiology:</strong> <em>Pellagra</em> is a rare deficiency commonly seen in alcoholics, patients with GI absorption issues, and individuals on restricted diets. Pellagra is characterized by "the 3 D's": Dermatitis, Diarrhea, and Dementia.</p>

<h2>Pyridoxine (<em>Vitamin B6</em>)</h2>

<p><strong>Physiology:</strong> Vitamin B6 is converted to pyridoxal phosphate, which is an enzyme cofactor used in the transamination reactions of amino acid metabolism, sphingolipid synthesis, and neurotransmitter synthesis.</p>

<p><strong>Pathophysiology:</strong> Symptoms of vitamin B6 deficiency include irritability, nervousness, and depression, as well as peripheral neuropathy and convulsions in a sever deficiency. A large fraction of the population of the US consumes less than the RDA of pyridoxine.</p>

<h2>Biotin (<em>Vitamin B7</em>)</h2>

<p><strong>Physiology:</strong> Biotin functions as a cofactor for CO2 activation in carboxylase enzymes.</p>

<p><strong>Pathophysiology:</strong> Biotin deficiency is rare, although it is most commonly seen in pregnant women. Biotin can also be sequestered by a protein in egg whites called avidin.</p>

<h2>Folate (<em>Vitamin B9</em>)</h2>

<p><strong>Physiology:</strong> Folate is converted to tetrahydrofolate (THF) which is utilized extensively in 1-carbon metabolism. This means folate is necessary for amino acid and nucleotide metabolism, as well as DNA synthesis and cell proliferation.</p>

<p><strong>Pathophysiology:</strong> Folate deficiency inhibits DNA synthesis leading to anemias, as well as neural tube defects in infants born to deficient mothers. Folate deficiency is commonly seen in alcoholics.</p>

<h2>Cobalamin (<em>Vitamin B12</em>)</h2>

<p><strong>Physiology:</strong> Cobalamin is utilized in two reactions in humans. Methionine synthase (which converts homocysteine into methionine) and Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (which converts methylmalonyl-CoA into succinyl-CoA).</p>

<p><strong>Pathophysiology:</strong> Cobalamin deficiency leads to a buildup of homocysteine and methylmalonic acid, which leads to anemia and neurological damage. Cobalamin deficiency is rare in most cases, except in vegetarians and individuals with chronic GI absorption issues.</p>

<h2>Vitamin C (<em>Ascorbic Acid</em>)</h2>

<p><strong>Physiology:</strong> Vitamin C is used as a cofactor in enzymes involving the hydroxylation of lysine and proline which are then used in collagen. Vitamin C is also used non-enzymatically in the stomach to reduce Iron (III) to Iron (II), which is absorbed better. Laslty, vitamin C acts as a general antioxidant, protecting the other vitamins from oxidation.</p>

<p><strong>Pathophysiology:</strong> Mild vitamin C deficiency leads to decreased immunocompetence and weekend connective tissue causing easy bruising. Severe deficiency causes <em>scurvy</em>, which is characterized by osteoporosis, hemorrhages, anemia, and decreased wound healing.</p>

<button class="accordion">Minerals</button>
<div class="panel">
<h2>Calcium</h2>

<p><strong>Physiology:</strong> Calcium is utilized as a structural element in bones and as a second messenger for intracellular signaling. Calcium is also utilized in muscle contraction, nerve signalling, blood coagulation, and the actiation of certain proteins.</p>

<p><strong>Pathophysiology:</strong> Symptoms of calcium deficiency often mimic vitamin D deficiency, and result in muscle cramps among other symptoms (see Metabolic: Fluids and Electrolytes). Calcium deficiency is commonly seen in femalse and low-income children.</p>

<h2>Iron</h2>

<p><strong>Physiology:</strong> Iron is used in oxygen transport, metabolism, cell proliferation, and immune function. Free iron is toxic to cells, and as such free iron is sequestered in ferritin while inside cells, and in transferrin while in the blood.</p>

<p><strong>Pathophysiology:</strong> Iron deficiency produces anemia (see Hematologic: Anemia), and is commonly seen in children and menstruating females.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Trace Minerals</button>
<div class="panel">
<h2>Copper</h2>

<p><strong>Physiology:</strong> Copper is used by many enzymes, including those involved in iron reduction/oxidation as well as enzymes involved in collagen cross linking.</p>

<p><strong>Pathophysiology:</strong> Copper deficiency resembles scurvy, and presents with anemia, bone demineralization, and hemorrhages.</p>

<h2>Iodine</h2>

<p><strong>Physiology:</strong> Iodine is used in the production of thyroid hormones</p>

<p><strong>Pathophysiology:</strong> Iodine deficiency is uncommon now, as Iodine is added to table salt, but cases of Iodine deficiency present with <em>goiter</em>, and enlargement of the thyroid gland, and potentially <em>cretinism</em>, which is severely stunted mental and physical growth.</p>

<h2>Zinc</h2>

<p><strong>Physiology:</strong> Zinc is used for metaloenzymes and zinc-finger motifs in DNA binding domains.</p>

<p><strong>Pathophysiology:</strong> Zinc deficiency can cause poor growth and sexual development in children, as well as poor wound healing, dermatitis, and impaired immune function. Many individuals have a marginal dietary intake of Zinc.</p>
