# Pathophysiology

Autoimmune Igs are produced for an unknown reason and form immune complexes and activate the inflammatory response throughout the body. This immune activation and autoreactive Its lead to tissue damage, and immune complex deposition can lead to lupus nephritis.

# SSx

Many variable SSx, both constitutional and organ-specific

| Organ System   | SSx                                                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Systemic       | Fatigue<br />Fever<br />Wt Loss                              |
| Dermatological | Photosensitivity<br />Malar (butterfly) rash<br />Oral Ulcers<br />Alopecia<br />Raynaud's Phenomenon<br />Discoid Rash (Circular, red, and scaly) |
| Renal          | Lupus Nephritis<br />Hematuria / Proteinuria<br />Casts<br />Nephrotic Syndromes |
| GI             | N / V<br />Anorexia<br />Abd Pain                            |
| Psych / Neuro  | Psychosis<br />Szs<br />Depression<br />Anxiety              |
