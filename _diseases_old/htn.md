## BP Goals

|Condition    |Goal       |
|-------------|-----------|
|CVD          |&lt; 130/80|
|10y ASCVD Risk &gt; 10%|&lt; 130/80|
|Hx of Stroke \& HTN Before Stroke|&lt; 140/90|
|Hx of Stroke \& HTN After Stroke |&lt; 130/80|
|DM           |&lt; 130/80|

# HTN Agent Selection
* Caucasion: RAAS Inhibitors 1st Line
* AA: CCB or Thiazides 1st Line
* SIHD: &beta;-blockers 1st Line in combo with RAAS Inhibitors
* CKD 3 or CKD 1-2 w/ Albuminuria: RAAS Inhibitor
* Two or more agents often necessary in AA pts
* Pregnancy: Methyldopa, nifedipine, and/or labetalol are safe

# HTN Crisis

* **BP &ge; 180/120**
* Urgency: No other SSx except HA
* Emergency: SSx of organ dysfunction
  * SOB
  * Altered
  * EKG Changes
  * Increase in SCr of &ge; 0.5 if baseline is &lt; 3 or &ge; 1 if baseline is &gt; 3
  
## Goals
* Urgency
  * BP &lt; 160/110
  * MABP reduction by no more than 25% w/i 24hr using PO therapy
* Emergency
  * MAPB reduction of 10% in the 1st hour, then 15% in the next 2-3hrs

## Treatment
### Urgency
* Restart home PO therapy
* Add PO captopril, nicardipine, labetalol, or clonidine as appropriate
  * Captopril: 25mg q90-120min PRN (onsets in 15-30min)
  * Nicardipine: 30mg q8h PRN (onset in 0.5-2hr)
  * Labetalol: 200mg q3-4h PRN (onest in 1-2hr)
  * Clonidine: 0.1-0.2mg q1h NTE 0.7mg (onset in 15-30min)

### Emergency
* Nitroprusside: 0.3-0.5 mcg/kg/min NTE 2 mcg/kg/min
  * Last line due to cyanide toxicity
* Nicardipine: 5-15 mg/hr
* Esmolol: 500 mcg/kg Bolus q5min x1 OR 50-100 mcg/kg/min (cardioselective &beta;-blocker)
  * Good for CAD and anxiety
* Labetalol: 20-80mg Bolus q10min OR 0.5-2 mg/min
  * Good for brain syndromes and pregnancy
* NTG: 5-100 mcg/min
  * A loading dose of 400 mcg/min x2min may be kinetically appropriate, but not endorsed in guidelines
  * Good for CHF and Angina
* Hydralazine
  * 5-10mg q20-40min x1
  * **Not recommended in HTN emergency**
  * Drug of choice in pregnancy
