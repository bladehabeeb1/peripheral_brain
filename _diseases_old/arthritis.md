# Presentation

## Osteoarthritis

* Commonly affects distal interphalangeal joints, hips, and knees
* More common in elderly and women

### SSx

* Pain, worse w/ activity
* AM stiffness &lt; 1hr
* Crepitus (Crackling of joints)
* **Asymmetric**
* Muscle atrophy
* No systemic SSx
* Boney spurs, visible in hands (Herberden's and Bouchard's Nodes)

## Rheumatoid Arthritis

* More common in women, no age preference
* Shortens lifespan

### SSx

* Stiffness and muscle ache
* Fatigue
* Loss of Appetite
* Most commonly smaller joints, but can involve elbow, shoulder, hip, knee, ankles
* Symetrical
* Extra-Articular SSx
  * Rheumatoid nodules (most commonly in hands, elbows, and forearms)
  * Vasculitis
  * Pulmonary effusion and fibrosis
  * Ocular inflammation
  * Pericarditis
  * Heart conduction abnormalities
  * Feltys'
    * Splenomegaly
    * Neutropenia
  * Lymphadenopathy
  * Anemia

### Dx

* Apply following Dx procedure if pts have 1 joint w/ definite clinical swelling and clinical SSx are not better explained by another disease
* RA if Score &ge; 6
  * Joint Involvement
    * 1 medium-large joint (0 points)
    * 2-10 medium-large joints (1 point)
    * 1-3 small joints (2 points)
    * 4-10 small joints (3 points)
    * More than 10 small joints (5 points) 
  * Serology
    * Not positive for either RF or ACPA (0 points)
    * At least one of these two tests are positive at low titer, defined as more than the upper limit of normal but not higher than three times the upper limit of normal (2 points)
    * At least one test is positive at high titer, defined as more than three times the upper limit of normal (3 points) 
  * Duration of SSx
    * &lt; 6wks (0 points)
    * &ge; 6wks (1 point)
  * Acute Phase Inflammatory Mediators
    * Normal CRP and ESR (0 points)
    * Abnormal CRP or ESR (1 point)

     * May increase insulin resistance
   * Capsaicin, Menthol / Camphor / Wintergreen Oil may help
3. NSAIDs
   * All work, but Celebrex, Diclofenac / Misoprostol, and Naproxen / Esomeprazole prefered
   * Trial for 1-2 wks for pain or 2-4 wks for inflammation
