# Physiology

The thyroid gland is responsible for regulating the overall metabolic tone of an individuals body. This is accomplished through the release of two hormones, T3 and T4. T4 is converted to T3 in target tissues, and the two hormones are responsible for regulating growth and development, BMR, thermoregulation, catecholamine sensitivity, and protein synthesis rate. Thyroid peroxidase is used to place I<sup>-</sup> ions onto tyrosine residues of the protein thyroglobulin in the thyroid follicle. These tyrosine are then linked to form T3 and T4 trapped in thyroglobulin. Upon stimulation of the thyroid from TSH (released in response to TRH), the follicular cells uptake iodinated thyroglobulin and cleave off T3 and T4, releasing it to the blood stream to be transported by thyroxine-binding globulin and transthyretin, along with a small portion transported by albumin. Approximately 0.04% of T4 in plasma is free, as the proteins have a high binding affinity, and the reservoir of T3 and T4 in the body lasts approximately 2-3 months.

# Labs

    * Renal adjustment
    * Safe in 1st trimester only
    * Not for use when breastfeeding
    * Black box warning for hepatic failure
    * **Inhibits conversion of T4 to T3, making it preferable for thyroid storm**
  * SEs
    * N / V
    * Maculopapular rash
      * Give diphenhydramine
    * Wheals, hives, SOB
      * 50% cross reactivity
      * Treat w/ RAI or surgery, no more thioamides
    * Agranulocytosis
    * Hepatitis
      * LFTs at baseline and PRN
* Radioactive Iodine
  * **Absolute CI in pregnancy, lactation, and planning pregnancy w/i 4-6mo**
  * Avoid physical contact &gt; 5d after dose
* Surgical thyroidectomy
* Adjunctive &beta;-Blockers
  * HR &lt; 90
  * Short term only
  * Propranolol 10-40mg Q6H PRN
    * Partially blocks T4 into T3
  * Metoprolol 25-50mg QID
  * Atenolol 25-100mg QD or BID
  * Can consider Non-DHP CCBs as well
  * Avoid ISA &beta;-blockers

## Monitoring

* TSH at baseline, q4-8wks until stable / first 3-4mo, then q3-4mo

# Hypothyroidism

## Causes

* Amiodarone
* Li
* Interferons
* Bexarotene
* Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (autoimmune condition killing thyroid)
* Radiation exposure
* Iodine Deficiency
* Congenital conditions
* Pituitary damage

## SSx

* Pale, cool skin

* Lethargy
* Decreased appetite
* Wt gain
* Hypoglycemia
* Increased lipids

## Treatment

* Thyroid hormone replacement
* Levothyroxine (T4, Tirosint, Synthroid, Levoxyl, Unithroid)
  * First line
  * Take on empty stomach 60min before meal or 3hr after
  * See dosing table below
* Liothyronine (T3, Cytomel, Triostat)
  * Rapid absorption can cause cardiac toxicities
  * More expensive
  * BID-QID dosing
* Liotrix (T4 and T3, Thyrolar)
  * 4:1 T4:T3
  * Expensive
  * Fluctuating and often elevated T3
* Desiccated Thyroid (Armour Thyroid, Nature Thyroid, NP Thyroid)
  * Can cause allergy
  * No reason to use
