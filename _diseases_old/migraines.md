# Headache Classification
* Primary
	* Tension Type
		* Tension HA: Bilateral over forehead and neck
		* Cervical Osteoarthritis: Neck
		* Chronic Myositis: Inflammation of muscle tissue 
	* Vascular Type
		* Migraine
		* Cluster: Severe, usually w/ autonomic SSx
		* Non-Migraine Vascular: Hangovers, HTN, and post-ictal
* Secondary
	* Trauma
	* Aneurysm and Vascular Malformations
	* Tumor
	* Some systemic disorers
	* Medication-induced

# Pathophysiology
The pathophysiology is not fully elucidated. The current theory is that the primary underlying physiology is an intial vasospasm followed by prolonged vasodilation, leading to inflammation and edema. The current theory of the cause of the vasospasm is a phenomena known as the Cortical Spreading Depression (CSD).
For an unkown reason, areas of high brain activity, often the occipital lobe, can produce a wave-front of decreased cortical function accompanied by increased extracellular K, H+, and NO, leading to activation of nociceptors of the trigeminal nerve (CN-V) innervating the meninges. This promotes the release of CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide), Substance-P, and other neuroinflammatory peptides and inflammatory mediators, which results in significant vasodilation and pain.
Relevant 5-HT receptors for migraines include the 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1D</sub>, and 5-HT<sub>1F</sub> receptors, which mediate vasoconstriction, inhibition of neurotransmitter release, and inhibition of neuroinflammatory peptides and nociceptive signalling respectively.

# Treatment
## Treatment Principles
* Mild-moderate disease
	* Initiate NSAIDs or APAP
	* Initiate combination of APAP / ASA / Cafeine if response inadequate
	* Initiate Severe therapy if inadequate response
* Severe
	* Initiate triptans or ergotamines
	* Initiate combination therapy if response inadequate
	* Sumatriptan, rizatriptan, almotriptan, eletriptan, and zolmitriptan 1st line
	* Naratriptan or frovatriptan for better tolerability
	* Ergotamine or DHE for infrequent HAs or to decrease cost (but less effective)
* Avoid acute therapy to &le; 2d per week
* Add antiemetics if necessary
	* Metoclopramide 10mg
