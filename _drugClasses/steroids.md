# Steroid Biosynthesis

![Steroid Biosynthesis Pathway]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/steroidogenesis.svg)

## Genetic Errors

* 17&alpha;-Hydroxylase deficiency leads to overproduction of MCs and a deficiency of GCs and sex hormones
  * Causes &approx; 5% of cases of adrenal hyperplasia
  * SSx: Hypocortisolism causing adrenal hyperplasia, ambiguous genitalia, and hyperaldosteronism
* 21-hydroxylase deficiency leads to low levels of GCs and MCs, and high levels of sex hormones, notably increasing androgen levels in females
  * Causes &approx; 95% of cases of adrenal hyperplasia
  * SSx: Ambiguous genitalia in females, premature epiphyseal closure, and hirsutism

# Physiology of Steroids

* Transcortin (Corticoid-binding globulin) transports GCs and MCs in plasma, SHBG (sex-hormone binding globulin) transport testosterone and estrogen
* Most are metabolized in the liver
* Estrogen is uniquely excreted in the bile, and undergoes enterohepatic recycling, all others are excreted in the urine
* Function by binding to nuclear receptors, dimerizing them, and acting as a transcription factor

# Drugs Impacting Steroid Hormone Synthesis

* Aminoglutethimide
  * Inhibition of P450scc (CYP11A1, converts cholesterol to pregnenolone)
  * Decreases production of all steroid hormones
* Ketoconazole
  * Blocks P450scc, 17&alpha;-hydroxylase, and 11&beta;-hydroxylase
  * Can be used to treat hyperglucocorticoid states

# Glucocorticoids

* Regulated by HPT Axis
  * CRH released from hypothalamus, causing ACTH (corticotropin) release from anterior pituitary, causing cortisol release from adrenal cortex, which inhibits CRH and ACTH release
* Increase the production of PEP carboxykinase and lipocortin I
  * PEP-C increases the rate of gluconeogenesis (raising BG)
  * Lipocortin I suppresses Phospholipase A2, inhibiting eicosanoid synthesis
* Activated GC receptor also binds NF&kappa;B and prevents its activity as an inflammatory transcription factor

## Physiologic Effects

* Liver
  * Increased gluconeogenesis and glycogen storage
* Muscle
  * Promote breakdown
  * Decrease protein synthesis
  * Decrease insulin response
* Adipose tissues
  * Promote lipolysis
  * Decrease insulin response
* Immunosuppression

## GC Disorders

### Addison's Disease / Adrenal Insufficiency

* Not the same as Adrenal Fatigue (fictitious Dx used in alternative medicine)
* Primary Adrenal Insufficiency is Addison's Disease
* Pathophysiology
  * Decreased GC release caused by: destruction of adrenal cortex (primary), atrophy due to long-term external GCs (primary), decreased ACTH production (secondary), or decreased CRH production (tertiary)
  * Differentiate between primary and tertiary / secondary by evaluating for hypoaldosteronism
* SSx
  * Weakness
  * N / V
  * Anorexia
  * Anemia
  * Low BP in Addison's Disease (due to concomitant hypoaldosteronism)
  * Hyperpigmentation of skin in Addison's (ACTH precursor cleaved to increase adrenal output, but cleavage also produces melanocyte stimulating hormone)
* Treatment
  * Hydrocortisone 15-25 mg QD or cortisone 20-35 mg QD or Prednisone 3-5mg QD
  * Acute Adrenal Crisis: 100mg IV hydrocortisone followed by 200mg QD (NTE 200-400mg QD) continuous infusion x24hr, reduce to 100mg QD once stable, then taper

### Cushing's

* Hypersecretion of adrenal hormones or excessive administration of external GCs
* DDx
  * Suspicion of Cushing's should be investigated with 24hr urine cortisol and low-dose dexamethasone suppression test
  * If abnormal, test plasma ACTH and high-dose dexamethasone suppression test
  * Low ACTH and no suppression => Adrenal Tumor / Adrenal Cushing's
  * High ACTH and no suppression => Ectopic Cushing's
  * High ACTH and suppression => Pituitary Cushing's
* Pathophysiology
  * Either adrenal tumor, pituitary tumor, or ectopic tumor producing ACTH
  * Differentiation by ACTH level (high in secondary and tertiary, low in primary)
* SSx
  * Muscle wasting
  * "Moon Face"
  * Redistribution of fat from limbs to trunk
  * Fatty hump
  * Osteoporosis
  * Immunosuppression / infection

### Conn's Syndrome

* Lack of 17&alpha;-hydroxylase in the adrenal cortex only

* Leads to GC deficiency and hyperaldosteronism, but adequate sex hormone production

* Typically caused by an adrenal adenoma

* SSx

  * Hypernatremia
  * Polyuria (from hypernatremia)
  * Alkalosis
  * Alkalosis (via opposite mechanism of Type IV RTA, high export of H+ due to incredible aldosterone levels)
  * HTN
