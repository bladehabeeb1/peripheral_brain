# Coagulation Cascade

![Coagulation Cascade](../images/coagulation_cascade.png)

Clotting Factors are produced exclusively in the liver, with the exception of vWF (endothelium, subendothelium, and megakaryocytes) and Factor VIII (liver and endothelium). The cascade begins when Tissue Factor (TF) binds to Factor VII after vascular wall injury exposes extra-vascular tissue. This process begins the extrinisic pathway. The intrinsic pathway is initiated by thrombin (Factor IIa) cleaving Factor XII in response to exposed collagen from damaged endothelial cells. The coagulation cascade is naturally inhibited by Antithrombin III (AT, neutralizes Thrombin, Xa, and IXa), Protein C (neutralizes Va and VIIIa), and Xa (activates Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor).

# Anticoagulant Classes

* Vitamin K Antagonists
  * Warfarin
* Factor Xa Inhibitors
  * Direct: Rivaroxiban, Apixaban, and Edoxaban
  * Indirect: Unfractionated Heparin, LMWH (Enoxaparin / Daltaparin), Fondaparinux
* Direct Thrombin Inhibitors
  * Dabigatran

# Warfarin

**MOA:** Inhibition of Post-Translational Modification of Factors II (Prothrombin), VII, IX, and X along with  Proteins C and S via inhibition of Vitamin K Reductase (which regenerates reduced vitamin K for post-translational modificaiton)

Warfarin takes approximately 3-5 days to reach maximal effect due to the half-lives of the respective clotting factors

1. Prothrombin (factor II): 60-100 hours
2. Factor VII: 4-6 hours
3. Factor IX: 20-30 hours
4. Factor X: 24-40 hours

Protein C and S have significantly shorter half-lives, and initiation of warfarin therapy can temporarily lead to an increase in coagulability. This can lead to ischemia and Warfarin Induced Necrosis.

Warfarin is a mix of S and R enantiomers, the S enantiomer being 5x more effective at inhibiting Vit K Reductase.

## Dosing

Dosed to reach a goal INR of 2-3 for prophylaxis or treatment of VTE, treatment of PE, prevention of symbolic emboli, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and mechanical aortic valve. A target of 2.5-3.5 is used for mechanical mitral valves or to prevent a reccurent MI.

Initial dosing is typically 5mg daily, but healthy outpatients can be given a loading dose of 10mg x2d. Doses should be adjusted weekly, and the total **weekly** dose should be adjusted, not the daily dose. Patients which may require a dose smaller than 5mg include:

* \> 60 years old (elderly)
* Debilitated
* Malnourished
* Congestive heart failure
* Liver disease
* Concomitant medications (check for interactions)
* High bleeding risk
* Genetic factors

### Duration of Therapy

| Indication             | Duration                                 |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Reversible Risk Factor | 3mo                                      |
| Idiopathic DVT         | &ge; 3mo, re-evaluate and consider up to 1yr |
| DVT + Cancer           | **LMWH** for 3-6mo then warfarin or **LMWH** indefinitely or until cancer resolves |
| Multiple Events        | Lifelong therapy, consider &ge; 3mo if high bleeding risk |
