# Physiology
Insulin and glucagon are the primary controllers of glucose metabolism and BG levels. Insulin is released and binds to insulin receptors on target cells, which then phosphorylates itself, leading to intracellular activation and phosphorylation of target proteins.

| Transporter | Glucose Km | Activity        | Location                        |
|-------------|------------|-----------------|---------------------------------|
| GLUT 1      | 1-2 mM     | Constitutive    | Widely Expressed                |
| GLUT 2      | 15-20 mM   | Constitutive    | &beta;-Cells, Liver             |
| GLUT 3      | &lt; 1 mM  | Constitutive    | Neurons                         |
| GLUT 4      | 5 mM       | Insulin Induced | Skeletal Muscle<br/> Adipocytes |

Insulin is released from the pancreactic &beta;-cells after a complex signalling pathway. first, glucose enters through GLUT2 transporters, and are rapidly metabolized by glucokinase (which is un-saturated at physiologic concentrations and produces G6P at a rate proportional to the concentration in the cell). Subsequent glucose metabolism increased the level of ATP in the cell relative to ADP, which closes an ATP-gated K channel, removing a hyperpolarizing stimuli, which in turn depolarizes the cell, triggering the activation of VCa channels. The influx of calcium mobilizes insulin granules on myosin filaments, leading to insulin release.

Pro-GLP-1 is released upon entry of food into the duodenum, which stimulates insulin release, suppresses glucagon release, slows gastric emptying, and enhances &beta;-cell proliferation and function. GLP-1 is broken down in plasma by DPP-4
