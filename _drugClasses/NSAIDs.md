# COX Physiology

Two isophorms: COX-1 and COX-2, which produce PGE<sub>2</sub>, PGF<sub>2&alpha;</sub>, PGI<sub>2</sub>, and TXA<sub>2</sub> from arachidonic acid. COX-1 controls most physiologic aspects of prostaglandin activity: gastroprotection, coagulation balance, etc. COX-2 is primarily used for inflammation and adaptive responses to the environment

| Prostaglandin          | Blood Vessel | Plts                      | Bronchi      | Uterus       |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| PGE<sub>2</sub>        | Dilation     |                           | Dilation     | Dilation     |
| PGF<sub>2&alpha;</sub> | Constriction |                           | Constriction | Constriction |
| PGI<sub>2</sub>        | Dilation     | Inhibition of Aggregation |              |              |
| TXA<sub>2</sub>        | Constriction | Promotion of Aggregation  |              |              |

# Prostaglandin Drugs

* Alprostadil is PGE<sub>1</sub>
  * Used for ED as a penile suppository or local injection
* Misoprostol is a PGE<sub>1</sub> derivative
  * Used in combination with NSAIDs to decrease GI SEs and to increase uterine dilation
* Latanoprost is a PGF<sub>1&alpha;</sub> prodrug
  * Glaucoma
* Prostacyclin is PGI<sub>2</sub>
  * Used as a vasodilator and for pulmonary arterial hypertension
  * Avoid w/ anticoagulants

# NSAIDs

## Salicylates

* Aspirin
  * Comparatively high anti platelet activity
* Salsalate (DIsalcid)
  * Minimal GI SEs (dimer that is not active until in the presence of esterases in the small intestine)
* Diflunisal (Dolobid)
  * More potent analgesia, less potent antipyretic activity than ASA, 3-4x longer lasting

## Arylacetic Acids

* Indomethacin
  * Highly potent
  * Many SEs
  * Acute use only
* Sulindac
  * Prodrug
  * Minimal GI SEs
  * Suitable for long-term use
* Etodolac
  * As potent as indomethacin
  * Somewhat COX-2 selective
  * Suitable for long-term use
* Diclofenac
  * As potent as indomethacin
  * Somewhat COX-2 selective
  * Inhibits lipoxygenase (leukotriene synthesis) as well

## Arylpropionic Acids

* Ibuprofen
  * More potent than ASA
  * Less potent than indomethacin
* Naproxen
  * More potent than ibuprofen
  * Moderate GI irritation
* Ketorolac (Tordal)
  * Good for acute severe pain
  * Analgesia similar to opioids
  * NTE &approx; 5d consecutive use

## Non-carboxylated

* Nabumetone
  * Prodrug
  * Minimal GI actvity
  * Great anti-inflammatory, minimal analgesia
* Meloxicam
  * Long-lasting, QD dosing
  * As potent as indomethacin

## COX-2 Selective

* Celcoxib (Celebrex)
  * Great for pain, inflammation, fever
  * Minimal GI SEs
  * As potent as naproxen
  * Inhibition of COX-2 inhibits PGI<sub>2</sub> synthesis in vascular endothelia, leading to unopposed TXA<sub>2</sub> from plts, leading to increased clot risk

## SES

* N / V
* GI Ulceration
  * Primarily caused by acidity of molecules
  * Worsened by decrease in cytoprotective prostaglandin synthesis
* AKI
* Hypersensitivity
* Reye's Syndrome w/ Salicylates
  * Rare, but life threatening
* Tinnitus
* Dizziness
* HA
