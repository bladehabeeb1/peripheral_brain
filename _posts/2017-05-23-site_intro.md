## Markdown
For those of you that are interested in helping create content for this website, the only thing I ask is that you produce your work in *Markdown*. *Markdown* is a set of tags for annotating text for use in webpages. It is really straight forward, and a full guide can be found [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). Just as an example, below I will demonstrate the common tags, and what they look like with this website's formatting. If you a desire to make an entry or two, feel free to type up one and email it to me.
