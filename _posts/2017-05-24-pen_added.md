title: New Content (PEN, Labs, and Formulas)

Enteral nutrition has been added to the [PEN page]({{ site.baseurl }}/diseases/metabolic/nutrition/pen.html), and PN will be added soon.

[Formulas]({{ site.baseurl }}/formulas.html) have been updated to include some of the most common, as well as what I came across while combing through the PEN notes. More will be added as they are encountered in the notes.

[Lab Values]({{ site.baseurl }}/lab_values.html) has been updated to hold common labs, and similarly to [Formulas]({{ site.baseurl }}/formulas.html), I will update the labs as I encounter more throughout the notes.

Section headings for the disease/condition notes are now collapsable, tap/click to expand or contract them.

Lastly, feel free to report errors or suggestions on [About]({{ site.baseurl }}/about.html) by following the links.
