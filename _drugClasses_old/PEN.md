## Energy Needs

### Harris-Benedict Equations

$$
\text{Male BMR} = 66 + 13.7\; \text{Wt} + 5\; \text{Ht} - 6.8\; \text{Age}\\
\text{Female BMR} = 655 + 9.6\; \text{Wt} + 1.7\; \text{Ht} - 4.7\; \text{Age}\\
\text{Wt}\; (kg), \; \text{Ht}\; (cm)
$$

### TEE

| Condition                                  | Goal kcal/kg/d |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| Non-Stressed, Non-Depleted                 | 20-25          |
| Trauma / Stress / Surgery / Critically Ill | 25-30          |
| Major Burn                                 | 35-40          |
| Obesity                                    | 22-25 (IBW)    |

$$
\frac{\text{Wt}}{\text{IBW}} < 1.3 \implies \text{Wt}\\
\frac{\text{Wt}}{\text{IBW}} > 1.3 \implies \text{NWB}\\
\frac{\text{Wt}}{\text{IBW}} > 1.5 \implies \text{IBW}\\
\text{NBW} = \text{IBW} + 0.25\left(\text{Wt} - \text{IBW}\right)
$$



### Daily Protein Needs

| Condition                 | Goal g/kg/d |
| ------------------------- | ----------- |
| Maintenance               | 0.8-1       |
| Repletion / Medical Floor | 1-1.5       |
| Trauma / Surgery / ICU    | 1.5-2       |
| Burn                      | 2-2.5       |
| Obesity                   | 2 (IBW)     |

## Nitrogen Balance 

Determinant of protein status (negative balance indicates protein breakdown, positive indicates healing / protein synthesis).
$$
\text{Nitrogen Balance} = \frac{\text{24h Protein Intake (g)}}{6.25} + \left( \text{24h UUN (g)} + 4\;\text{(g)}  \right)
$$
**Goal Nitrogen Balance:** 0 for maintenance, (+)3-5 for repletion

## Building a TPN

1. Determine Total Daily Calories and Total Daily Protein
2. Calculate Total Daily Non-Protein Calories
3. Determine an appropriate Carb / Fat Ratio
   * Typically 70%/30%, but can vary from 60-85%/15-40%
4. Add Micronutrients PRN

## Respiratory Quotient

$$
\text{RQ} = \frac{\text{vCO}_2}{\text{vO}_2}
$$

| RQ   | Predominately Oxidized Substance |
| ---- | -------------------------------- |
| 0.7  | Fat                              |
| 0.8  | Protein                          |
| 1    | Carbs                            |

* **Goal RQ:** 0.85-0.95
* RQ > 1: Overfeeding and lipogenesis

# Enteral Nutrition

Pre-made enteral nutrition solutions exist at 1 and 2 kcal/mL concentrations. 2 kcal/mL should be used in fluid restricted patients.

## Administration Methods

* Continuous: Utilizes a pump, lower distention (and therefore aspiration) risk
* Intermittent: Several gravity based feeds of &gt; 200mL over 20-30min
* Bolus: &gt; 200mL over 5-10min (high aspiration risk)
* Cyclic: Administered over 8-20hr QD

## Medication Administration Through Feeding Tubes

[**ISMP Do Not Crush List**](http://www.ismp.org/tools/donotcrush.pdf )

If a medication can be crushed:

1. Crush
2. Administer w/ 5-30mL flush
3. Repeat for each medication
4. Give final flush

# Nutritional Disorders

## Vitamin Deficiencies

### Lipophilic Vitamins

* Vit A (retinoids and beta-carotene)
  * Involved primarily in vision, but also as hormones
  * Stored in the liver (and Vit A overdose can be hepatotoxic)
  * Dietary sources include dark green vegetables, liver, egg yolk, and fatty dairy products
  * Deficiency is rare, but can lead to night vision blindness
* Vit D (Cholecalciferol and Ergocalciferol)
  * Provitamin D<sub>3</sub> can be produced in the skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol
  * A cis double bond in Pro-D<sub>3</sub> is isomerized into D<sub>3</sub> (cholecalciferol)
  * Cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol (Vit D<sub>2</sub> from plants) are then hydroxylated in the liver to form 25-hydroxy Vit D<sub>3</sub>, and again in the kidney to form 1,25-dihydroxy Vit D<sub>3</sub> or calcitriol, the active biologic agent responsible for calcium homeostasis
  * Deficiency is rare, but causes Rickets in children and Osteomalacia in adults
  * Dietary sources include fortified milk, saltwater fish, liver, and egg yolk
* Vit E (Tocopherols and Tocotrienols)
  * Function as potent antioxidants protecting unsaturated fatty acids
  * May prevents LDL oxidation helping to prevent CVD
  * Dietary sources are vegetable oils rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids
  * Deficiency is rare
* Vit K
  * Functions as an enzyme cofactor for the glutamate post-translational modification to carboxyglutamic acid, which is essential for allowing proteins to tightly bind Ca
  * Vit K dependent post-translational modifications are required for bone mineralization (hydroxyapatite production) and coagulation (multiple clotting factors are Vit K dependent)
  * Deficiency is rare
  * Dietary sources include green, leafy vegetables for Vit K<sub>1</sub> and gut bacterial synthesis for Vit K<sub>2</sub>

### Hydrophilic Vitamins

* Vit B<sub>1<sub> (Thiamin)
  * Utilized as an enzyme cofactor in many enzymes via carbanion production, including many enzymes involved in glucose metabolism
  * Severe deficiency is known as beriberi, which is characterized by muscle weakness
  * **Deficiency is most commonly seen in alcoholics, and administration of dextrose containing fluids in thiamin deficient patients can result in Wernicke's Encephalopathy**
    * Pretreat w/ 100mg IM or slow IVPB in suspected deficiency
    * May need up to 1000mg in the 1st 24hrs
  * **Chronic deficiency can also lead to Korsakoff's psychosis, which is irreversible and responds poorly to antipsychotics (but they should still be used)**
* Vit B<sub>2</sub> (Riboflavin)
  * Used as an enzyme cofactor (FAD and FMN)
  * Deficiency is rare, but SSx include Cheilitis, Glossitis, and Scaly dermatitis, and is most commonly seen in alcoholics
  * Dietary sources include milk, meat, eggs, and cereal products
* Vit B<sub>3</sub> (Niacin)
  * Converted to NAD and NADP
  * Deficiency (pellagra) is common in pts with malabsorption diseases or alcoholics
  * Pellagra presents with "The 3 D's": Dermatitis, Dementia, and Diarrhea
  * Dietary sources include meats, peanuts, and enriched cereals
* Vit B<sub>6</sub> (Pyridoxine)
  * Pyridoxal phosphate is a cofactor for neurotransmitter and sphingolipid synthesis as well as amino acid metabolism
  * Severe deficiency is uncommon, with SSx including irritability, nervousness, and depression in mild cases and peripheral neuropathy and Szs in severe deficiency
  * Dietary sources include meats, vegetables, and whole-grain cereals
* Vit B<sub>7</sub> (Biotin)
  * Cofactor for the conversion of carboxylates to CO<sub>2</sub>
  * Deficiency is somewhat rare, and most common in pregnant women
  * Biotin binds incredibly tightly to avidin in egg whites (used throughout biochemical studies and assays, as well as a potential cause of deficiency)
* Vit B<sub>9</sub> (Folate)
  * Converted to tetrahydrofolate which is essential for one-carbon metabolism in a.a. and nucleotide synthesis
  * Deficiency is most common in alcoholics, with notable SSx of macrocytic anemia and neural tube defects in children born to pregnant women with the deficiency
* Vit B<sub>12</sub> (Cobalamin)
  * Co containing "heme" group
  * Required for two human biochemical reactions: methionine synthase (homocysteine into methionine) and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (methylmalonyl-CoA into succinyl-CoA)
  * Deficiency leads to homocysteine and methylmalonate accumulation causing macrocytic anemia and neurologic damage
  * Deficiency can be dietary or "pernicious anemia" in which the absorptive cofactor (intrinsic factor) is absent or non-functioning
  * Deficiency is most commonly seen in long-term vegetarians or malabsorption diseases
* Vit C (Ascorbic Acid)
  * Cofactor for lysine hydroxylation (essential for collagen production)
  * Reducing agent promoting iron absorption and protection of oxidation prone vitamins (A, E, and some B)
  * Deficiency (Scurvy) marked by slow wound healing, decreased immunocompetency, osteoporosis, leading from mucosal membranes (especially the gums), and ulcerations across the body

## Refeeding Syndrome

### SSx

* Szs
* Coma
* Arrhythmias
* Lactic Acidosis
* Pulmonary Edema
* Fluid Overload

### Monitoring

* SSx
* Mg
* K
* Phos

### Prevention

* Correct electrolyte abnormalities first
* Start all patients at 50% goal caloric intake, high risk at 25% goal caloric intake
  * Titrate to goal over 3-5d
* If SSx emerge decrease calories and correct emergent electrolyte problems

## Kwashiorkor

Protein based malnutrition characterized by hypoalbuminemia, anemia, edema / ascites, muscle atrophy, impaired immune function, and delayed wound healing. Treat w/ slow introduction of food to avoid referring syndrome.

## Marasmus

 Caloric malnutrition characterized by wt loss, reduction of basal metabolic rate, depletion of fatty stores, bradycardia, and hypothermia. Treat w/ slow introduction of food to avoid referring syndrome.

## Essential Fatty Acid Deficiency

### SSx

* Dry Skin
* Immune Complications
* Thrombocytopenia
* Alopecia
* Peds
  * Mental Development Delays

### Treatment

4-10% of QD calories as Linoleic and Linolenic Acid
