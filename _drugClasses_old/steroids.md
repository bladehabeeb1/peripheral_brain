# Steroid Biosynthesis

![Steroid Biosynthesis Pathway]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/steroidogenesis.svg)

## Genetic Errors

* 17&alpha;-Hydroxylase deficiency leads to overproduction of MCs and a deficiency of GCs and sex hormones
  * Causes &approx; 5% of cases of adrenal hyperplasia
  * SSx: Hypocortisolism causing adrenal hyperplasia, ambiguous genitalia, and hyperaldosteronism
* 21-hydroxylase deficiency leads to low levels of GCs and MCs, and high levels of sex hormones, notably increasing androgen levels in females
  * Causes &approx; 95% of cases of adrenal hyperplasia
  * SSx: Ambiguous genitalia in females, premature epiphyseal closure, and hirsutism

# Physiology of Steroids

* Transcortin (Corticoid-binding globulin) transports GCs and MCs in plasma, SHBG (sex-hormone binding globulin) transport testosterone and estrogen
* Most are metabolized in the liver
* Estrogen is uniquely excreted in the bile, and undergoes enterohepatic recycling, all others are excreted in the urine
* Function by binding to nuclear receptors, dimerizing them, and acting as a transcription factor

# Drugs Impacting Steroid Hormone Synthesis

* Aminoglutethimide
  * Inhibition of P450scc (CYP11A1, converts cholesterol to pregnenolone)
  * Decreases production of all steroid hormones
* Ketoconazole
  * Blocks P450scc, 17&alpha;-hydroxylase, and 11&beta;-hydroxylase
  * Can be used to treat hyperglucocorticoid states

# Glucocorticoids

* Regulated by HPT Axis
  * CRH released from hypothalamus, causing ACTH (corticotropin) release from anterior pituitary, causing cortisol release from adrenal cortex, which inhibits CRH and ACTH release
* Increase the production of PEP carboxykinase and lipocortin I
  * PEP-C increases the rate of gluconeogenesis (raising BG)
  * Lipocortin I suppresses Phospholipase A2, inhibiting eicosanoid synthesis
* Activated GC receptor also binds NF&kappa;B and prevents its activity as an inflammatory transcription factor

## Physiologic Effects

* Liver
  * Increased gluconeogenesis and glycogen storage
* Muscle
  * Promote breakdown
  * Decrease protein synthesis
  * Decrease insulin response
* Adipose tissues
  * Promote lipolysis
  * Decrease insulin response
* Immunosuppression

## GC Disorders

### Addison's Disease / Adrenal Insufficiency

* Not the same as Adrenal Fatigue (fictitious Dx used in alternative medicine)
* Primary Adrenal Insufficiency is Addison's Disease
* Pathophysiology
  * Decreased GC release caused by: destruction of adrenal cortex (primary), atrophy due to long-term external GCs (primary), decreased ACTH production (secondary), or decreased CRH production (tertiary)
  * Differentiate between primary and tertiary / secondary by evaluating for hypoaldosteronism
* SSx
  * Weakness
  * N / V
  * Anorexia
  * Anemia
  * Low BP in Addison's Disease (due to concomitant hypoaldosteronism)
  * Hyperpigmentation of skin in Addison's (ACTH precursor cleaved to increase adrenal output, but cleavage also produces melanocyte stimulating hormone)
* Treatment
  * Hydrocortisone 15-25 mg QD or cortisone 20-35 mg QD or Prednisone 3-5mg QD
  * Acute Adrenal Crisis: 100mg IV hydrocortisone followed by 200mg QD (NTE 200-400mg QD) continuous infusion x24hr, reduce to 100mg QD once stable, then taper

### Cushing's

* Hypersecretion of adrenal hormones or excessive administration of external GCs
* DDx
  * Suspicion of Cushing's should be investigated with 24hr urine cortisol and low-dose dexamethasone suppression test
  * If abnormal, test plasma ACTH and high-dose dexamethasone suppression test
  * Low ACTH and no suppression => Adrenal Tumor / Adrenal Cushing's
  * High ACTH and no suppression => Ectopic Cushing's
  * High ACTH and suppression => Pituitary Cushing's
* Pathophysiology
  * Either adrenal tumor, pituitary tumor, or ectopic tumor producing ACTH
  * Differentiation by ACTH level (high in secondary and tertiary, low in primary)
* SSx
  * Muscle wasting
  * "Moon Face"
  * Redistribution of fat from limbs to trunk
  * Fatty hump
  * Osteoporosis
  * Immunosuppression / infection

### Conn's Syndrome

* Lack of 17&alpha;-hydroxylase in the adrenal cortex only

* Leads to GC deficiency and hyperaldosteronism, but adequate sex hormone production

* Typically caused by an adrenal adenoma

* SSx

  * Hypernatremia
  * Polyuria (from hypernatremia)
  * Alkalosis
  * Alkalosis (via opposite mechanism of Type IV RTA, high export of H+ due to incredible aldosterone levels)
  * HTN

# Estrogens and Progestins

![Ovarian Cycle]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/ovarianCycle.png)

* Estrogen and progesterone are released from the ovaries in response to FSH and LH, and based upon the concentration of estrogen and progesterone, cause either positive or negative feedback regulating the release of GnRH, LH, and FSH
* Estrogen and progesterone suppress FSH in the early follicular phase
* Estrogen and progesterone stimulate the LH and FSH surges leading to ovulation in the late follicular phase
* Estrogen and progesterone suppress LH and FSH in the luteal phase
* Successful implantation leads to the production of hCG by the embryo, which acts in a similar manner to LH, increasing the production of progesterone in the first trimester to maintain the endometrium
* Estrogens are unique among the steroid hormones, as the undergo significant bile excretion and enterohepatic circulation
