# Na Channel Mediated MOA

## Hydantoin Derivatives (Phenytoin, etc.)

### MOA

Binds and stabilizes the inactivated state of Na Channels

### Example Drugs

* Phenytoin
* Fosphenytoin
* Ethotoin (fewer SEs than phenytoin, but less effective)
* Mephenytoin (more toxic than phenytoin)

### Phenytoin

Phenytoin has unique PK properties, as the metabolic enzymes which control phenytoin metabolism are saturated at therapeutic concentrations. This leads to non-linear pharmacokinetics. Phenytoin is also highly protein bound, and induces CYP enzymes leading to a large number of drug interactions

## Iminostilbenes (Carbamazepine, etc.)

### MOA

Iminostilbenes bind and stabilize the incativated state of Na channels in the brain in a similar way to hydantoins (their 3D structures are very similar); however their planar structures are tricyclic. Iminostilbenes induce hepatic CYPs leading to many drug interactions

### Example Drugs

* Carbamazepine
* Oxcarbazepine

## Lacosamide

### MOA

Enhances the inactivation of Na channels

# Ca Channel Inhibitors

## Clinical Uses

Absence Szs only

## Succinimides

### MOA

Inhibition of T-Type Ca Channels in thalamic neurons

## Example Drugs

* Ethosuximide (Zarontin)
* Methsuximide (more toxic)
* Phensuximide (less effective)

# Mixed Na and Ca Inhibitors

## Lamotrigine (Lamictal)

### MOA

Inhibition of Ca and Na channels (has effects of both classes, and can therefore be used for more than absence Szs). Also disrupts glutamate release

## Valproate (Depaken, Depakote)

### MOA

Inhibition of Ca and Na channels (has effects of both classes, and can therefore be used for more than absence Szs). Increases GABA levels by stimulating glutamic acid decarboxylase or inhibiting GAt-1 or GABA-T

# GABAergic Drugs

## Barbiturates

### MOA

PAM of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors increasing the **duration** of Cl entry into the post-synaptic neuron (an inhibitory signal). At high concentrations these drugs can also inhibit Na and Ca channels. Primidone may have more similar behaviors to phenytoin.

### Example Drugs

* Phenobarbital (Luminal)
* Primidone (Mysoline)

## Benzodiazepines

### MOA

PAM of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors increasing the **frequency** of Cl opening events, hyperpolarizing the post-synaptic neuron.

### Example Drugs

* Diazepam (Valium)
* Lorazepam (Ativan)
* Clonazepam (Klonopin)

## GABA Analogs

### MOA

Increases GABA release and potentially decreases presynaptic Ca influx reducing glutamate release.

### Example Drugs

* Gabapentin (Neurontin)
* Pregabalin (Lyrica)

## Vigabatrin (Sabrile)

### MOA

Analog of GABA which irreversibly inhibits GABA transaminase, which normally degrades GABA. Mat also inhibit GAT.

## Tiagabine (Gabatril)

### MOA

Inhibits GAT-1 (GABA vesicular transporter)

# Glutamate Antagonists

## Felbamate (Felbatol)

### MOA

NMDA Antagonist (NMDA Usually triggers influx of Na and Ca, along with Efflux of K) and enhanced GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling.

## Topiramate

### MOA

AMPA (Na influx and K efflux) and Kainate antagonist. Inhibition of Na Channels. Enhanced GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling.

# Misc Anticonvulsants

## Levetiracetam (Keppra)

### MOA

Binds SV<sub>2</sub>A (Synaptic Vesicular Protein) interfering with neurotransmitter release. May also interfere with Ca influx in presynaptic neurons

## Brivaracetam (Briviact)

### MOA

Analog of levetiracetem with higher affinity for SV<sub>2</sub>A
